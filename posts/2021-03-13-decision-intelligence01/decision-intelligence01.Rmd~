In February, 2021, Bay Area health officers published an article ["Crisis Decision-Making at the Speed of COVID-19: Field Report on Issuing the First Regional Shelter-in-Place Orders in the United States"](https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/fulltext/2021/01001/crisis_decision_making_at_the_speed_of_covid_19_.5.aspx). In this article we briefly summarized the emerging, trans-disciplinary area of decision intelligence relevant to public health.

In this blog entry, I briefly summarize key concepts and its importance to public health and other fields.

## Decision making

### Role of causal and probabilistic reasoning

**Decision making** is our most important daily activity. Decisions drive
vision, strategy, execution, problem solving, performance, evaluation,
and continuous improvement. Decisions can be rapid and guided by
experience and intuition, or they can be the product of a slow,
deliberative process, usually by teams. So, what is a decision?

"A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves
an irrevocable allocation of resources." Every decision has causal
assumptions, predictions, and opportunity costs. For example, we might choose
option $A$ over option $B$ because we predict option $A$ will achieve outcome
$Y$ with probability $P$ (often unstated). The **opportunity cost** is
the lost benefit of the better option not chosen or not
considered. Implicit (non-conscious) cognitive biases, individually
and collectively, can drive the strength of our causal beliefs,
predictions, and decisions.  Therefore, to improve team decision
making, we also need to strengthen our capabilities in causal
and probabilistic reasoning, balancing trade-offs from
competing objectives, and leading team deliberations in the face of
volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (so-called VUCA).

What public health officials bring to the table are the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics that support causal and probabilistic reasoning, respectfully. Causal reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the key drivers? (root causes); Why and how is this happening? (root causes); Asking “why?” 5 times. (“The 5 Whys”); Does this countermeasure work? (efficacy); Will it work in the real world? (effectiveness); and Which intervention is more cost-effective? (efficiency). 

Probabilistic reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the chances that this exposure leads to infection? (prediction); What are the chances this countermeasure will work? (prediction); What are the sensitivity and specificity of this test or classification? (proportion of false-negative and/or false-positive of any test result or conjecture). This type of reasoning,

$$
\Pr (\text{effect} \mid \text{cause})
$$
$$
\Pr (\text{evidence} \mid \text{hypothesis})
$$
$$
\Pr (\text{test results} \mid \text{presence of disease})
$$
is called causal (or predictive) reasoning. 


In contrast, What are the chances my hypothesis (conjecture, suspected diagnosis) is correct, given the evidence? What is the chance of being infected given a test result? This type of reasoning,

$$
\Pr (\text{cause} \mid \text{effect})
$$
$$
\Pr (\text{hypothesis} \mid \text{evidence})
$$
$$
\Pr (\text{presence of disease} \mid \text{test results})
$$
is called evidential (or diagnostic) reasoning and is the reverse of causal reasoning. Unfortunately, human beings are very poor at evidential reasoning because it requires Bayes theorem to calculate probabilities. Humans are unaware of this cognitive limitation; hence, we are overconfident in our assessments and, with confirmation bias, may develop certainty and rigid beliefs. For these reasons, we must approach VUCA with genuine intellectual humility and embrace curiosity over certainty. In fact, in the face of VUCA, key decisions are better managed like hypotheses to be tested.

Every decision involves intuition, emotions, and cognitive and social psychology. Because of VUCA, decision making is often more art than science, and the “art” depends on psychological safety and effective interpersonal skills for managing conflict and building consensus. Decisions in organizational environments evolve within a historical, political, and cultural context that may constrain or support good decision making.

## Decision intelligence

For public health officials, **decision intelligence** is the
practical integration of problem solving, decision quality, performance improvement, and data science.

### Problem solving

Many public
health officials use components of decision intelligence but are
unaware of its integrated structure.  Figure \@ref(fig:psolve)
graphically depicts the problem-solving structure as a causal graph
(also called directed acyclic graph or DAG).

```{r psolve, fig.cap="Causal graph to guide problem solving", out.width="80%", fig.align = "center"} 
knitr::include_graphics("images/FIG5_Problem-Solving_causal-graph.png") 
```

The easiest example to understand is clinical diagnosis and treatment. When a patient presents to an emergency room with chest pain (**problem**), the clinician considers and prioritizes **consequences** (death, discomfort, etc.) and **causes** (myocardial infarction, esophageal reflux, anxiety, etc.), tests hypotheses by collecting data (history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests), and then uses the results to select and implement a treatment plan (**countermeasures**). The patient's response to treatment is more data for learning, and for adjusting hypotheses and treatments. This whole process is a series of problem solving decisions, learning, and continuous improvement. The seasoned clinical is an expert in clinical decision intelligence. 

### Decision quality

Similarly, complex problem-solving is a series of important, causally-linked decisions to (a) select and focus on the right problem, consequences, and root causes, and (b) design, evaluate, and improve countermeasures (prevention, control, mitigation) to achieve the primary objectives while minimizing harmful outcomes and unintended consequences. 

**Decision quality** is understanding and improving the requirements of making good decisions (Figure \@ref(fig:dqr)) even when the decisions are intuitive and fast.  Decision quality  has these requirements (1) **frame** the decision problem or opportunity, including identifying values and setting decision objectives; (2) gather relevant data and **information**; (3) generate creative, doable **alternatives** (choices); (4) conduct sound **reasoning** to select or prioritize the best alternatives to achieve the objectives; (5) involve the right stakeholders and build consensus (**commitment** to action); and (6) understand the consequences, trade-offs, and opportunity costs (**prospects**).


```{r dqr, fig.cap="Decision quality requirements", out.width="80%", fig.align = "center"} 
knitr::include_graphics("images/FIG4_Decision-Quality_diverg-converg2.png") 
```


At a minimum, a decision quality checklist (Table \@ref(tab:dqr)) improves the quality of decisions at any stage of problem solving.

Table: (\#tab:dqr) Decision quality requirements engages multiple disciplines and skillsets

| No. | Requirement  | Priority areas for development, training, and improvement                       |
|-----+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1 | Frame            | $\leftarrow$ **decision competency** in PDSA **problem solving**  |
|   2 | Information      | $\leftarrow$ **data** and **information systems**     |
|   3 | Alternatives          | $\leftarrow$ **knowledge management** (discovery, translation, and integration) |
|   4 | Reasoning        | $\leftarrow$ **causal and probabilistic reasoning** combined with **data science**         |
|   5 | Commitment       | $\leftarrow$ Involved **stakeholders** increases commitment to action                  |
|   6 | Prospects        | $\leftarrow$ Understand the **consequences**, trade-offs, and opportunity costs       |


Team problem solving is a series of deliberative decision processes that are divergent (generating creative ideas and options) and convergent (selecting or prioritizing options for action). First, selecting the right problem to tackle is a decision problem, and it is the most important. 
Second, a root cause analysis identifies what causes the problem. Third, selecting countermeasures for root causes, problem, and consequences is, again, a decision problem. The key point is that problem-solving is a series of linked, interdependent decisions, each with quality requirements. The quality of a decision can only be as strong as its weakest link, and the quality of problem solving can only be as strong as the quality of those decisions.


## Performance improvement

Put together, decision intelligence is the integration of problem solving and decision quality within a **performance improvement framework**, ensuring quality and continuous improvement in decision making. Table 2 summarizes decision intelligence as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) problem solving.

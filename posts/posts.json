Decisions can be rapid and guided by experience and intuition, or they can be the product of a slow, deliberative process, usually by teams. So, what is a decision?\n“A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources” [1]. Every decision has a causal assumption, a prediction, and an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost is the lost benefit of the better option not chosen or not considered. The most common decision we make everyday is how we spend our time and with whom we spend it.\nMost decisions are automatic and influenced by intuition. Occasionally, we slow down to deliberate in teams and we are influenced by our intuition, non-conscious cognitive processes, group psychology, power dynamics, and politics.\nIn spite of the importance of decision making, few are trained on how to make better decisions. I am often asked what are my favorite decision books. To promote better decision making I list several here in their primary category.\nPlease send me your favorite decision book recommendations and why to like them.\nPrerequisites\nHess E.

In this article we discussed the application of decision intelligence (DI) to a public health crisis.\nIn this blog entry, I briefly summarize key DI concepts. One of my goals is to clarify that “data-driven decision making” is an incomplete construct for DI.\nDecision making\nCausal and probabilistic reasoning\nDecision making is our most important daily activity. Decisions drive vision, strategy, execution, problem solving, performance, evaluation, and continuous improvement. Decisions can be rapid and guided by experience and intuition, or they can be the product of a slow, deliberative process, usually by teams. So, what is a decision?\n“A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources” [1]. Every decision has causal assumptions, predictions, and opportunity costs. For example, we might choose option \\(A\\) over option \\(B\\) because we predict option \\(A\\) will achieve outcome \\(Y\\) with higher probability \\(P\\) (often unstated). The opportunity cost is the lost benefit of the better option not chosen or not considered. Implicit (non-conscious) cognitive biases, individually and collectively, can drive the strength of our causal beliefs, predictions, and decisions. Therefore, to improve team decision making, we also need to strengthen our capabilities in causal and probabilistic reasoning, balancing trade-offs from competing objectives, and leading team deliberations in the face of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (so-called VUCA).\nWhat public health officials bring to the decision-making table are the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics that support causal and probabilistic reasoning, respectfully. Causal reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the key drivers? (root causes); Why and how is this happening? (root causes); Asking “why?” 5 times. (“The 5 Whys”); Does this countermeasure work? (efficacy); Will it work in the real world? (effectiveness); and Which intervention is more cost-effective? (efficiency).\nProbabilistic reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the chances that this exposure leads to infection? (prediction); What are the chances this countermeasure will work? (prediction); What are the sensitivity and specificity of this test or classification? (proportion of false-negative and/or false-positive of any test result or conjecture). This type of reasoning,\n\\[\n\\Pr (\\text{effect} \\mid \\text{cause})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{evidence} \\mid \\text{hypothesis})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{test results} \\mid \\text{presence of disease})\n\\] is called causal reasoning (or predictive reasoning).1\nIn contrast, What are the chances my hypothesis (conjecture, suspected diagnosis) is correct given the evidence? What is the chance of being infected given a test result? This type of reasoning,\n\\[\n\\Pr (\\text{cause} \\mid \\text{effect})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{hypothesis} \\mid \\text{evidence})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{presence of disease} \\mid \\text{test results})\n\\] is called evidential reasoning (or diagnostic reasoning) and is the inverse conditional probability of causal reasoning. Unfortunately, human beings are very poor at evidential reasoning because it requires Bayes theorem to calculate probabilities. Humans are unaware of this cognitive limitation; hence, we are overconfident in our assessments and, with confirmation bias, may develop certainty and rigid beliefs. For these reasons, we must approach VUCA with genuine intellectual humility and embrace curiosity over certainty. In fact, in the face of VUCA, key decisions are better managed like hypotheses to be tested.\nEvery decision involves intuition, emotions, and cognitive and social psychology. Because of VUCA, decision making is often more art than science, and the “art” depends on psychological safety and effective interpersonal skills for managing conflict and building consensus. Decisions in organizational environments evolve within a historical, political, and cultural context that may constrain or support good decision making.\nThe failure to understand basic causal and evidential reasoning leads to wrong inferences, rigid beliefs, and poor decisions. We have seen this time and time again in the SARS’CoV-2 pandemic. The only practical and effective approach is to embrace humility, curiosity, and learning.\nDecision intelligence\nFor public health officials, decision intelligence is the practical integration of problem solving, decision quality, performance improvement, and behavioral, data, and information sciences.2\nProblem solving\nMany public health officials use components of decision intelligence but are unaware of its integrated structure. Figure 1 graphically depicts the problem-solving structure as a causal graph (also called directed acyclic graph or DAG).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal graph to guide problem solving\n\n\n\nThe easiest example to understand is clinical diagnosis and treatment. When a patient presents to an emergency room with chest pain (problem), the clinician considers and prioritizes consequences (death, discomfort, etc.) and causes (myocardial infarction, esophageal reflux, anxiety, etc.), tests hypotheses by collecting data (history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests), and then uses the results to select and implement a treatment plan (countermeasures). The patient’s response to treatment is more data for learning, and for adjusting hypotheses and treatments. This whole process is a series of problem solving decisions, learning, and continuous improvement. The seasoned clinical is an expert in clinician decision intelligence.\nDecision quality\nSimilarly, complex problem-solving is a series of important, causally-linked decisions to (a) select and focus on the right problem, consequences, and root causes, and (b) design, evaluate, and improve countermeasures (prevention, control, mitigation) to achieve the primary objectives while minimizing harmful outcomes and unintended consequences.\nDecision quality is understanding and improving the requirements of making good decisions (Figure 2) even when the decisions are intuitive and fast. Decision quality has these requirements (1) frame the decision problem or opportunity, including identifying values and setting decision objectives; (2) gather relevant data and information; (3) generate creative, doable alternatives (choices); (4) conduct sound reasoning to select or prioritize the best alternatives to achieve the objectives; (5) involve the right stakeholders and build consensus (commitment to action); and (6) understand the consequences, trade-offs, and opportunity costs (prospects).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Decision quality requirements\n\n\n\nAt a minimum, a decision quality checklist (Table 1) improves the quality of decisions at any stage of problem solving. A good decision is only as strong as its weakest link.\nTable 1:  Decision quality requirements engages multiple disciplines and skillsets\nNo.\nRequirement\nKey questions to ask\n1\nFrame\nWhat are we deciding and why?\n2\nInformation\nWhat do we need to know?\n3\nAlternatives\nWhat creative choices do we have?\n4\nReasoning\nAre we thinking straight?\n5\nCommitment\nIs there commitment to action? Are we thinking straight?\n6\nProspects\nWhat future states do we care about?\nTable 2 summarizes specific areas of professional and systems developement to improve decision quality.\nTable 2:  Decision quality requirements engages multiple disciplines and skillsets\nNo.\nRequirement\nPriority areas for development, training, and improvement\n1\nFrame\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) decision competency in PDSA problem solving\n2\nInformation\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) data and information systems\n3\nAlternatives\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) knowledge management (discovery, translation, and integration)\n4\nReasoning\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) causal and probabilistic reasoning, deliberation, and data science\n5\nCommitment\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) Engage and involve stakeholders to increase commitment to action\n6\nProspects\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) Understand the consequences, trade-offs, and opportunity costs\nTeam problem solving is a series of deliberative decision processes that are divergent (generating creative ideas and options) and convergent (selecting or prioritizing options for action). First, selecting the right problem to tackle is a decision problem, and it is the most important. Second, a root cause analysis identifies what causes the problem. Third, selecting countermeasures for root causes, problem, and consequences is, again, a decision problem. The key point is that problem-solving is a series of linked, interdependent decisions, each with quality requirements. The quality of a decision can only be as strong as its weakest link, and the quality of problem solving can only be as strong as the quality of those decisions.\nPerformance improvement\nPut together, decision intelligence is the integration of problem solving and decision quality within a performance improvement framework, ensuring quality and continuous improvement in decision making. Table 3 summarizes decision intelligence as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) problem solving.\nTable 3:  Decision intelligence is the integration of problem solving and decision quality within a performance improvement framework\nPDSA\nComponents of Problem Solving\nKey decision questions\nPlan\nProblem finding and definition\nWhat is main problem to solve?\n\nConsequence (risk) analysis\nWhat are the consequences?\n\nRoot cause (diagnostic) analysis\nWhat causes the problem?\n\nCountermeasure design and testing\nWhat strategies and actions work?\nDo\nCountermeasure implementation\nHow do we deploy countermeasures?\nStudy\nCountermeasure (causal) evaluation\nHow do we measure and test effectiveness?\nAct\nAct on what you learn to improve\nHow do we learn and improve?\nWe can now appreciate that PDSA problem-solving is a series of decisions (Figure 3): finding and selecting the most important problems to tackle; identifying and prioritizing the consequences caused by the unresolved problem(s); identifying (or discovering) and prioritizing the root causes of the problem(s); selecting effective countermeasures for each level (problem, root causes, and consequences); and deploying and evaluating the effectiveness of the countermeasures where evaluation is a type of causal analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PDSA problem solving is a series of decisions\n\n\n\nBehavioral, data, and information sciences\nDecision intelligence starts with mastering the concepts above which can improve everyday important decisions. Without this foundation it is not possible to optimally use data and information. We often jump to building flashy data dashboards for making “data-driven” decisions without checking if we are solving the right problem or if we have good decision processes to begin with.\nFinally, decisions involve people and actions. So we must understand basic behavioral sciences, especially behavioral economics.\nI will cover these topics in future blog updates.\nSummary\nDecision intelligence is integration of\nproblem solving,\ndecision quality,\nperformance improvement, and\nbehavioral, data, and information sciences3\nDecision intelligence4 is often promoted through the lens of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The link is through human sensory input and processing of data and “information” in Table 2. However, I believe decision intelligence concepts are applicable for everyday use, and therefore much more generalizable and powerful.\nIn future blog entries I will expand on these concepts with more emphasis on practical applications and data science.\n\n\n\n1.

    "contents": "\nSince 1996, I served the City and County of San Francisco in numerous deputy health officer roles, eventually becoming the health officer in December 2010. I was born in San Francisco and grew up in the Mission District—a low-income, predominantly Latino community. My family immigrated from Nicaragua in the 1950s and the Mission was home to a large concentration of Central American immigrants. I was honored and proud to be the health officer of my city of birth.\nAt the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), local public health practice provided me with many unique challenges and opportunities. I was also the director of the Population Health Division that provided core public health services. I grew tremendously in my organizational and community leadership roles, and my partnerships with academic institutions such as UCSF and UC Berkeley School of Public Health fulfilled my nerdy inclinations. Over the years I worked with the California Department of Public Health on a variety of problems from communicable disease outbreaks to radiation concerns at the Hunter Points Naval Shipyard. However, I never—and I mean never!—imagined working for the state public health department—I wanted to stay close to the action; that is, local public health.\nBefore my health officer appointment, I had directed national CDC research and training centers on infectious disease emergency preparedness and response at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I had put that part of my career completely behind me and was more focused on broader public health challenges such as racial health inequities. I also developed a strong interest in leadership development, decision intelligence, and organizational performance improvement. The SFDPH became a laboratory for testing, learning, and teaching. I was professionally and intellectually fulfilled.\nThat all changed with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In December 2019, we started receiving news about an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Because of my training and expertise in communicable diseases, and my experience with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic flu in 2009, I was especially attuned to the evolving events.\nOn January 13, 2020, I med with Dr. Julie Stoltey, our communicable disease controller, and on January 21st we activated our Departmental Operations Center (DOC). We have been working non-stop since with very few days off. The pandemic not only disrupted our society and economy, it revealed and amplified pre-existing racial inequities. It also revealed the longstanding neglect of the public health infrastructure at all levels of government. Finally, people started to understand what is public health.\nMarch 15, 2020, a group of seven Bay Area health officers, led by Dr.Sara Cody, issued the first stay-at-home orders in the United States. We successfully prevented many cases, hospitalization, and deaths. Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of a long haul of fighting this relentless and unforgiving pandemic. Fortunately, the rapid development of effective vaccines meant real hope was around the corner, and that we would be transitioning into a recovery and rebuilding phase. This also means rebuilding the public health infrastructure for the 21st century.\nWhen the job announcement for the CDPH director and state public health officer was posted, I immediately applied. I could not pass up the opportunity to shape the future of public health services for a state of 40 million people, to advocate for the resources to rebuild our public health infrastructure, and to fight for social and racial equity and health on a larger stage. I was humbled and honored to be selected to serve in this position at this critical time in our history.\nI just completed seven weeks! I am exhausted, and at times overwhelmed and over extended! (So, what else is new!) My strongest impression working at CDPH is the enormous level of staff dedication, kindness, ingenuity, and passion for public service and science. I am inspired every single day! The CDPH staff are working 24/7 to protect and promote health and safety for the diverse counties and communities across the state. It’s a huge privilege to work more closely with health officials of the County Health Executives Association of California (CHEAC) and the Health Officers Association of California (HOAC), and with stakeholder and advocacy groups representing the diverse interests of California residents. They too are working just as hard and long to protect all of us.\nRebuilding public health requires everyone. I hope you will reach out to me and provide input and feedback on our and my performance, and how we can “become the best at getting better” in service to you.\nTo learn more about CDPH visit https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/About.aspx.\n\n\n\n",

The history of the Causal Revolution will surprise, inspire, entertain, and—at times—shock you! Below is my 5-star Amazon review of the Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect (which became an Amazon “Best Seller” within the first week of its release!).\n“Wow! I am a physician epidemiologist with a doctorate in epidemiology and I teach computational epidemiology (with R) at UC Berkeley. I had the opportunity to study biostatistics from the best professors at UC Berkeley School of Public Health (Steve Selvin, Nicolas Jewell, Richard Brand, and many more). The field of causal inference was just beginning to take off with biostatisticians piloting the plane (Mark van der Laan, Nicolas Jewell, etc.). I avoided a rigorous study of causal inference but eventually came around after studying Bayesian networks (pioneered by Judea Pearl) for decision analysis. Judea Pearl’s Bayesian networks and causal graphs connects the fields of statistics, epidemiology, decision and computer sciences in a profoundly elegant way. His work empowers and expands the potential of”big data.\" This is the first book written for the general public on this topic. It will have a huge impact. Causality and causal reasoning is at the core of everything we see, do, and imagine. He provides a graphical tool (causal graphs) for encoding expert knowledge (including community wisdom and experience). Anyone—yes, anyone—can learn the basics. For additional rigor, there are structural causal models (functional equations). I now consider it “data scientific malpractice” to be designing studies, analyzing data, and adjusting for confounders without using causal models. Human brains are wired to resist new paradigms. Be intellectually wise and humble and read this book–you will not regret it!\"\nThe Ladder of Causation\nBy the end of this book you will understand, appreciate, and value the “Ladder of Causation” (Figure 1)1 as a way of thinking about decision making, causal reasoning, and causal discovery. You will develop a different appreciation of the important roles of epidemiology and statistics which have embraced the Causal Revolution.

This book will set you on the right course.\nAt birth, the brain is a blank slate awaiting “wiring instructions” from a caregiver. Every second we are alive the brain processes “big data” of sensory input from our body (through interoception) and from the external world (through our senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Through evolution, humans solved a neurobio-engineering problem: how do we efficiently procure and balance energy and accumulate learnings on how to survive and procreate. The brain evolved into a predictive learning machine. The memories we accumulate through experiences become the predictions (“hypotheses” or “priors”) that the brain compares to new sensory input (“evidence”). The gap between prediction and sensory input is prediction error. If the prediction error is small or negligible the brain accepts the prediction, thereby saving cognitive energy expenditure. If the prediction error is large (e.g., cognitive dissonance), the brain must choose either to accept the prediction (cognitively and energy efficient, so our brain strongly prefers this), or to learn (cognitively and energy inefficient, so our brain strongly resists this).\nThe brain must make meaning of this sensory input in order to prepare for what the body needs to do next (based on prior experiences) to survive, etc. The brain prepares the body to respond through our nervous, cardiovascular, immune, endrocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Emotions are the on-the-spot meanings the brain gives to these external and internal sensory input (bodily sensations). “In other words, emotions are your brain’s best guess of how you should feel in the moment. Emotions aren’t wired into your brain like little circuits; they’re made on demand. As a result, you have more control over your emotions than you might think.”1\nAll of this happens automatically at a nonconscious level: that is why it “feels” like our emotions are “triggered.” In fact, our emotions are constructed in the moment based on:\nsensory input (from body [interoception] and surroundings [exteroception], includes social environmental context),\ngoal (survive, human drives, etc.),\npredictions (memories accumulated from prior experiences).2\nThe implications of understanding this evolution-designed engineering achievement are huge! How the brain processes the big data of sensory input also provides lessons on how we should process the new big data we are accumulating in the “cloud.” (Hint: read my book review of Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect.)\nDesigning an emotionally fulfilling life\nEven today, we are taught, incorrectly, that emotions are hardwired by evolution and that we should “control” (i.e., suppress), accept (i.e., embrace), or release emotions. For example, someone or something “triggers” an emotion and a stress response (“fight-flight-freeze”) in us, and we can use mindfulness to notice, acknowledge, and “release” this emotion. Yes, mindfulness works; however, mindfulness is much more powerful when we understand that emotions are acutually constructed rathered than “triggered.”\nWe have the power to design and build an emotionally fulfilling life by the experiences we choose to have and the cognitive and motor memories we encode in our brains. This explains how “doing” rewires the brain! Interestingly, Buddhism3 practices (e.g., mindfulness meditation) align nicely with this modern scientific understanding of brain and emotions. For example, Dr. Barrett studies and describes how Buddhism can strengthen interpersonal relationships and improve your brain and body health.4\nMindfulness promotes stillness, awareness, and being in the moment without judgment or expectation. Then, we can exercise curiosity about what contributed or is contributing to our feelings (affect) and emotions (meaning). This is critical because our brains are quick to draw false conclusions to save cognitive energy rather than to “get it right.” Interestingly, the more vocabulary we have to describe feelings and emotions, the more ability we have to recognize these in ourselves and others. This is called emotional granularity and is the actual basis of emotional intelligence.5\nDr. Barrett’s How Emotions are Made covers many practical applications of this emerging science, including mitigating implicit racial bias.\nKey resources from Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\nDr. Feldman Barrett’s book covers a lot of content. To get you oriented, I recommend first watching the three videos below. The first video is 5 minutes, followed by two TED talks by LFB.\n1: This is why you feel the way you feel\nThis is an outstanding 5-minute summary of construction of emotions:\n\n\n\n\n2 (TED): You aren’t at the mercy of your emotions: Your brain creates them\n“Can you look at someone’s face and know what they’re feeling? Does everyone experience happiness, sadness and anxiety the same way? What are emotions anyway? For the past 25 years, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett has mapped facial expressions, scanned brains and analyzed hundreds of physiology studies to understand what emotions really are. She shares the results of her exhaustive research—and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.”\n\n\n\n\nSee reading list for above TED talk.\n3 (TED): Cultivating Wisdom: The Power Of Mood\n“Do you believe that what you see influences how you feel? Actually, the opposite is true: What you feel—your affect—influences what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett shares the groundbreaking discovery that you experience the world through affect-colored glasses. She also reveals how affect can be a source of wisdom that helps you to make better, wiser choices”\n\n\n\n\nLFB’s website (includes numerous academic lectures)\nHere is her website with a wealth of material: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/.\n\nBarrett LF.

However, not everyone feels comfortable introducing complex topics like cultural humility. I was fortunate to discover Professor Edward Hess’ book “Humility is the New Smart: Rethinking human excellence in the smart machine age.”1 I believe his book is a non-threatening, practical, and inspiring way to introduce humility to your staff. Based on Hess’ book, the article below is an excerpt from our population health lean reference document.2 … Tomás J. Aragón\n\nRedefining what it means to be “smart”\nOur world is changing fast! Automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence—the Smart Machine Age (SMA)—are disrupting and displacing the workforce. Transdisciplinary teamwork is the new norm. People skills, creative and critical thinking, innovation, and improvement are more important now than ever!\nUnfortunately, our native cognitive abilities have not evolved at the same pace.3 Our brain is wired to sense “dangers” and react based on perceived threats and emotions. Our brain is wired for efficiency: it defaults to personality traits, fast decisions via nonconscious schemas or learned mindsets. We resist new ideas that demand new cognitive effort. Our decisions are suboptimal due to cognitive biases: (a) protection of mindset, (b) personality and habits, (c) faulty reasoning, (d) automatic associations, (e) relative thinking, and (f) social influences.4\nHumans are prone to defensiveness from our innate drive to protect our ego5 and to avoid our fears (vulnerability, uncertainty, risk, intellectual or emotional exposure, uninvited scrutiny). Science shows these behaviors impede creativity, critical and innovative thinking, reflective listening, and emotionally engaging others.6 We mitigate these biases using brain science. We start with a new definition of “being smart” (“NewSmart”). We must embrace intellectual humility, honesty, and courage and redesign organizations for this new age. Professor Edward Hess’ NewSmart Humility has four interdependent components:\nNewSmart principles,\nHumility mindset,\nNewSmart behaviors, and\nNewSmart organization.7\nThe “NewSmart” principles\n“To change our mental model for the SMA,” Hess writes, \"we first need to accept a quality-based definition of ‘being smart’—a NewSmart—that we define as excelling at the highest level of thinking, learning, and emotionally engaging with others that one is capable of doing. NewSmart is a measure not of what you know or how much you know but of\nthe quality of your thinking, listening, collaborating, and learning;\nhow good you are at “not” knowing and decoupling your beliefs (not values) from your ego;\nhow good you are at being open to continually stress-testing your beliefs about how the world works;\nhow good you are at trying out new ideas and ways to accomplish your objectives and learning from those experiments.\"8\n“So what does the high-quality thinking, learning, and emotional engagement underlying NewSmart look like in practice?” The NewSmart principles are worth committing to memory:\n“I’m defined not by what I know or how much I know, but by the quality of my thinking, listening, relating, and collaborating.”\n“My mental models are not reality—they are only my generalized stories of how my world works.”\n“I’m not my ideas, and I must decouple my beliefs (not values) from my ego.”\n“I must be open-minded and treat my beliefs (not values) as hypotheses to be constantly tested and subject to modification by better data.”\n“My mistakes and failures are opportunities to learn.”\nThis Table compares the “old smart” to the NewSmart.\nOld smart\nNewSmart\nI know\nI’m good at not knowing\nI tell\nI ask\nDefend my views\nImprove my views\nSeek confirmation\nSeek truth\nClose mind\nOpen mind\nInsecure if beliefs are challenged\nInsecure if beliefs are NOT challenged\nMistakes are bad\nMistakes are learning opportunities\nPerfectionism\nLearning\nThe Humility mindset\nWe embrace two definitions of humility:\nDickson defines humility as “the noble choice to forgo your status, [and to] use your influence for the good of others before yourself,”9 and\nHess defines “Humility as a mindset about oneself that is open-minded, self-accurate, and ‘not all about me,’ and that enables one to embrace the world as it ‘is’ in the pursuit of human excellence.”10\n“Humility is a mindset that results in not being so self-centered, ego defensive, self-enhancing, self-promotional, and closed-minded—all of which the science of learning and cognition shows inhibit excellence at higher-order thinking and emotionally engaging with others.”11\nThe NewSmart behaviors\nThe NewSmart and Humility mindsets drive behaviors that are supported and improved with evidence-based skills. Hess clusters them into four behavioral categories:\nQuieting Ego,\nManaging Self (one’s thinking and emotions),\nReflective Listening, and\nOtherness (emotionally connecting and relating).\n(a) Quieting Ego\n“Quieting Ego is how we can deliberately work to reduce our reflexive emotional defensiveness; have empathy and open-mindedness; engage in Reflective Listening; and proactively seek other people’s feedback and perspectives to stress-test our own thinking. Quieting Ego is a way of practicing and operationalizing Humility. To quiet our ego is to perceive others and the world without filtering everything through a self-focused lens and to tamp down on negative or self-protective”inner talk\" that is driven consciously or subconsciously by our fears and insecurities.\"12 Quieting Ego starts with four evidence-based behaviors:\nmindfulness,\nmindfulness meditation,\ndaily Quiet Ego reminders, and\npracticing gratitude.\n(b) Managing Self (one’s thinking and emotions)\n“Managing Self—our emotions and thinking—aids us in engaging in the higher-level thinking and behavior required … . It’s necessary to remain open-minded and be willing to test our beliefs and modify our points of view if presented with better data. It’s also how we’re able to overcome our fear of mistakes in order to take ownership of them and learn from them, and helps us more effectively relate to and collaborate with others.”13\n“Managing Self comes from the science of ‘self-regulation’ and ‘self-control,’ which are broad psychological concepts that mean to monitor and manage one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors,”14 and start with these practices:\nslowing down,\nmanaging thoughts,\nmanaging emotions, and\nemotional intelligence.\nFor managing thoughts, Hess’ “thinking toolbox” starts with familiar concepts from population health lean (PDSA problem-solving, root cause analysis, etc.). We also highly recommend reading Richard Nisbett’s Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking.15\nFor managing emotions, “We’ve discussed how ego and fear are the two big learning inhibitors and explored our reflexive tendency as humans to be emotionally defensive and self-protective. We’ve discussed how negative emotions can undermine our behavior and thinking and how positive emotions can improve them. Stress, anger, and anxiety can cause narrow-mindedness and the fight-flee-or-freeze syndrome. … Positive emotions, on the other hand, have been scientifically linked not just to higher health and well-being but also to broader attention, open-mindedness, deeper focus, and more flexible thinking, all of which underlie creativity and innovative thinking. Positive emotions also improve decision making and general cognitive processing.”\nHess’ “managing emotions toolbox” includes effective techniques such as\npsychological distancing,\nreframing,\npositive memories,\npositive self-talk, and\nif-then implementation plans.\nSee Hess book for illustrative examples.16\nEmotional intelligence (EI) is “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. … Sensitivity to other people’s emotions has been found to be a key to effective collaboration.” The EI model includes these abilities:\nPerceive and differentiate emotions in self and others.\nUse emotions to facilitate reasoning, aid judgment and memory processes, problem solve, communicate with others, and facilitate open-mindedness.\nUnderstand emotions by analyzing the emotions of yourself and others.\nManage emotions in self and others.\n(c) Reflective Listening\n“Reflective Listening is so important because it underlies all [other skills]. Why? Because your thinking and learning are limited by cognitive biases, emotional defensiveness, ego, and fear. You need, then, to truly listen to others to open your mind, push past your biases and mental models, and mitigate self-absorption in order to collaborate and build better relationships. [We know from] evidence that it’s hard for any of us to critique our own thinking and truly think critically. We’re just too wired to confirm what we already believe, and we feel too comfortable having a cohesive simple story of how our world works. We need to have thinking ‘partners’ who force us to confront those biases, and we need to listen to them.”17\nReflective Listening includes these practices:\npreparing to listen reflectively,\nlistening with a Quiet Ego and an open mind, and\ninquiring with genuine curiosity, humility, and respect (humble inquiry).\nHere’s a preparation checklist for Reflective Listening:\nIs my mind clear? If not, take several deep, slow breaths.\nAm I calm emotionally? If not, take a few more deep breaths, focusing on breathing in for four seconds and very, very slowly breathing out for four seconds.\nSay to yourself a couple of times:\n“I am not my ideas.”\n“It’s not all about me.”\n“Don’t be defensive.”\n“Ask questions before telling.”\n“Don’t interrupt.”\n“Stay focused.”\n“Critique ideas, not people.”\n“Listen to understand, not to confirm.”\n(d) Otherness (emotionally connecting and relating)\nHess writes “We need others because we can’t think, innovate, or relate at our best alone. To relate to other people you first have to make a connection with them. It is by building a relationship over time that you build trust, and when you have caring trust, you have set the stage for the highest level of human engagement. … So how do you get better at connecting and relating? It’s quite obvious that connecting and relating to people is inhibited by arrogance, self-absorption, self-centeredness, not listening, closed-mindedness, lack of empathy, emotional defensiveness, and the ego protection and fear that flow from the Old Smart mental model. Accepting NewSmart and Humility as well as practicing Quieting Ego, Managing Self, and Reflective Listening lays the groundwork for relationship building with others.”\nOtherness behaviors include:\nusing the fives keys to connecting,\nbuilding trust and conveying caring,\npreparing for meetings,\nchoosing words wisely.\nThe five keys to connecting are\nbe present,\nbe genuine,\ncommunicate affirmation,\nlisten effectively, and\ncommunicate support.\nPrepare for meetings with this checklist:\nbe really present,\ngenuinely smile—a big smile,\nmake eye contact,\nbe positive,\nlisten reflectively,\nstay fully present, and\ndo no harm.\nChoose your words wisely: use “Yes, and” instead of “Yes, but” to build on the ideas of others; use “I believe” instead of “I think” to acknowledge your ideas are hypotheses open to critique and testing; use “I want to” instead of “I have to” and “I won’t” instead of “I can’t” to emphasize the power of choice.\nNewSmart organization\nFinally, design your organizational culture and environment for learning, adaptation, innovation, and improvement leveraging established psychological concepts:\npositivity (promote positive emotions, minimize negative emotions);\nself-determination theory (promote intrinsic motivation by supporting innate human drives for autonomy, relatedness, and competence); and\npsychological safety (feeling safe to speak freely; to experiment, fail, and learn; to seek and give constructive feedback; to challenge others’ thinking, including the “boss”).\nThe Table below summarizes the new cultural ways of a NewSmart organization.\nOld Cultural Ways\nNew Cultural Ways\nIndividuals win\nTeams win\nPlay cards close to the chest\nTransparency\nHighest-ranking person can trump\nBest idea or argument wins\nListening to confirrm\nListening to learn\nTelling\nAsking questions (humble inquiry)\nKnowing\nBeing good at not knowing\nIQ\nIQ and EQ (emotional intelligence)\nMistakes are always bad\nMistakes are learning opportunities\nCompete\nCollaborate\nSelf-promote\nSelf-reflect\nFootnotes\n\nHess E.

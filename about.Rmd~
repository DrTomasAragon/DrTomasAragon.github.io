I am the [State Public Health Officer and
Director](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/Meet-the-Director.aspx) of the
[California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/)
(CDPH).  Striving to embody and promote the universal values of
dignity, equity, compassion and humility, I work to mobilize
communities and institutions to transform policies and systems towards
a culture of equity, antiracism, healing and health for all people and
our planet. As State Public Health Officer, I exercise leadership and
legal authority to protect health and prevent disease. As CDPH
Director, I direct a nationally accredited state public health
department. I taught computational epidemiology with R at the
University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. Today, I
focus on organizational decision intelligence using improvement,
implementation, and data sciences. For scientific computing I promote
the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

Decisions drive vision, strategy, policy, and transformational change. Every decision has causal assumptions, predictions, trade-offs, and an opportunity cost—the lost benefit of the better option(s) not chosen or not considered.\nMost decisions are quick or automatic and are influenced by intuition. Occasionally, we slow down to deliberate (often in teams) and we are influenced by our intuition, non-conscious cognitive processes, group psychology, power dynamics, and politics.\nDecision intelligence is using ethics, science, and technology to improve individual and team decisions for finding and solving problems, and achieving objectives and key results in challenging, environments, including volatile, uncertain, complex, or ambiguous (VUCA) environments.\nIn spite of the importance of decision making, few are trained on how to make better decisions.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis is part of the series The CDPH Way—Becoming the best at getting better.\nFor background, here is an overview slide set and lean reporting templates.\nIn 1998, Melanie Tervalon and Jann Murray-García published a groundbreaking article that challenged the concept of “cultural competency” with the concept of “cultural humility” [1,2].\nCultural humility is committing to lifelong learning, critical self-reflection, and personal and institutional transformation. Accepting cultural humility means accepting that we can never be fully culturally competent. Cultural humility is the foundation for establishing trust and respectful relationships, and for managing differences and conflict. Cultural humility means\nPower is the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others, the course of events, or the allocation of resources. Power comes from positional, moral, or relational authority. Authority is granted by appointment or earned by trust and credibility. It is exercised by embodying universal values (humility, compassion, equity, dignity), or by persuasion, manipulation, or deceit. The dynamics and impacts of power are multi-dimensional, context dependent, cumulative, and can be subtle. For example, the mere presence of a boss can unintentionally shut down subordinates.\nPrivilege is a form of unearned power that comes from social advantage. All of us have some form of privilege. Privilege exists because of sociopolitical systems and cultural norms that create, reinforce, and amplify power inequities, explicitly or implicitly. For example, in the US, if you are like me: male, heterosexual, cisgender, or have lighter skin color, you have more privilege. You do not choose privilege, but you can acknowledge it, and, more importantly, you can make “the noble choice to forgo your status, [and to] use your influence for the good of others before yourself” — this is humility.\nFor our purposes, biases are preferences, cognitive processes, or inferences that shape our mental models, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in ways that cause or contribute to inequities in power, privilege, opportunities, or outcomes for ourselves and/or others. Biases can be known to you and others (open), known to you and not others (hidden), known to others but not you (blind spot), or not known to you and others (unknown).1\nImplicit biases account for the unknown and blind spot biases, and are the most challenging type of bias because we all have them, and they are difficult to identify, measure, and mitigate. For example, ambiguous hiring criteria are susceptible to implicit biases. Without unambiguous, objective criteria, hiring someone you “trust” is driven, unintentionally, by implicit biases.2\nLearn more about cultural humility from the following outstanding videos."

    "text": "2 Making single and multi-attribute decisions\n\n2.1 Single-attribute decision\nSuppose our team needs to select from several alternatives and it will be based on a single attribute; for example, choosing one of five available colors to paint our office. That attribute—color—becomes our single criterion and we apply the ranking method illustrated below. In this example the single attribute (color) represents the alternatives (five colors to choose from).\n\n\n2.2 Multi-attribute decision\nHowever, more commonly, based on our frame (values, objectives, and key results), our team needs to select from among several alternatives, each of which has mutliple attributes. Selection examples include buying a smartphone, hiring an employee, or selecting a vendor. As individuals and as a group, we have preferences for these attributes based on what we know (information) and what consequences and impacts we care about (prospects). We need sound reasoning but it will not require a complex decision analysis. Engaging the team in fair and transparent deliberative decision making builds trust, consensus, and commitment.\nOur main task is to (a) develop criteria based on these attributes, (b) weight the criteria based on importance to us (preference), and (c) rate the alternatives based on the criteria and evidence (data, community, experts, analysis). Ideally, the criteria should be weighted without any knowledge of the alternatives. This is to prevent evaluators from biasing the criteria weights in favor of their favorite alternative.\nIn this blog posting I show how to weight criteria using a simple ranking method. In a future blog post, I will show how to apply weighted criteria to rank and select alternatives. This first step, weighting criteria, is very powerful and practical. We will use a trivial example to nail down the concepts.\nNow, suppose we wish to buy a car and our choices are a Honda Civic, and Subaru Impreza, or Toyota Corolla. We have data on the following attributes: safety (S), mileage (M), reliability (R), color (C), price (P), and resale value (V). Table 2 summarizes the DQ requirements for buying our car.\n\n\nTable 2: Decision quality requirements for buying a car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nRequirement\nKey question to ask\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n1\nFrame\nAre we clear on the problem we are solving?\nNeed personal transportion.\n\n\n2\nValues\nHave we identified what we truly want?\nCar within my budget.\n\n\n3\nAlternatives\nDo we have a good set of alternatives?\nCivic, Corolla, or Impreza\n\n\n4\nInformation\nHave we gathered the relevant information?\nColor, mileage, price, reliability, safety, resale value\n\n\n5\nReasoning\nHow will we evaluate alternatives to find the one that gets us the most of what what we truly want?\nRanking algorithm using weight calculations\n\n\n6\nCommitment\nAre we committed to follow through on our choice.\nYes, my spouse approves."

    "text": "3 Calculating criteria weights—the easy way\nGroup deliberative decision-making is cognitively exhausting. So, anything you can do to make the process easier will keep team members engaged. Do not let “perfection become the enemy of the good”. The easiest way to generate criteria weights from a team of evaluators is to use a rank ordinal method [1].\nGive evaluators small pieces of paper with one criterion printed on on each. If we have five criteria, they get five small pieces of paper. Have them rank them from top to bottom. Once they have ranked them, tape their ranking onto an 8.5in x 11in paper and hand to the facilitator. This ranking is entered into the computer for analysis (see below).\n\n3.1 Ratio ordinal method in Julia\nI will demonstrate this method using the Julia language. This method can also be implemented using R, Python, or Microsoft Excel.\nFor rating the cars we have six criteria (attributes) for which we need to calculate weights:\n\nColor (C)\nMileage (M)\nPrice (P)\nReliability (R)\nSafety (S)\nValue, resale (V)\n\nWe have five evaluators that will rank the criteria based on their knowledge, experience, expertise, and wisdom. It is much better for them to rank the criteria independently and without thinking about specific cars, otherwise they may game (bias) the weighting.\nHere are the steps:\n\nSelect a ranking method to calculate weights for a specific number of criteria, in this case we have six criteria. We will write and use a Julia function that implements the SR method from [1].\nHave each evaluator independently rank the criteria.\nUse Julia to calculate the final criteria weights. We will use the split-apply-combine workflow that I introduced in a previous blog post and book review [2].\n\n\n3.1.1 Step 1: The SR method for generating criteria weights\nHere is the formula where \\(N\\) is the number of criteria, and \\(w_i^{SR}\\) is the weight for the \\(i^{th}\\) criterion [1].1\n\\[\nw_i^{SR} = \\frac{1/i + \\frac{N+1-i}{N}}{\\sum_{j=1}^N (1/i + \\frac{N+1-i}{N})}\n\\]\n\nusing DataFrames\nusing StatsBase\nfunction calculate_rank_weights(n::Int64)\n    num = zeros(n)\n    for i in 1:n\n        num[i] = (1/i) + ( (n + 1 - i) / n )\n    end\n    wi = num / sum(num)\n    return wi\nend\nwi = calculate_rank_weights(6)\n\n6-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.3361344537815126\n 0.22408963585434175\n 0.1680672268907563\n 0.12605042016806722\n 0.0896358543417367\n 0.05602240896358543\n\n\nThe weights sum to 1, as expected.\n\nround(sum(wi))\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Step 2: Evaluators rank the criteria\nFive evaluators rank the criteria based on their expertise.\n\neval1 = [\"Mileage\", \"Color\", \"Price\", \"Safety\", \"Reliability\", \"Value\"]\neval2 = [\"Mileage\", \"Color\", \"Safety\", \"Reliability\", \"Value\", \"Price\"]\neval3 = [\"Color\", \"Value\", \"Price\", \"Mileage\", \"Reliability\", \"Safety\"]\neval4 = [\"Mileage\", \"Value\", \"Color\", \"Safety\", \"Reliability\", \"Price\"]\neval5 = [\"Safety\", \"Price\", \"Color\", \"Reliability\", \"Mileage\", \"Value\"]\n\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"Safety\"\n \"Price\"\n \"Color\"\n \"Reliability\"\n \"Mileage\"\n \"Value\"\n\n\nNext, we organize the evaluator criteria rankings and the SR method criteria weights into a data frame with three columns:\n\nevaluators (optional)\nevaluator_rankings (required)\nweights (required)\n\n\nne = 5; # number of evaluators\nnc = 6; # number for criteria\nevaluators = repeat([\"eval\" .* string.(1:ne)...], inner=repeat([nc]))\nevaluator_rankings = vcat( eval1, eval2, eval3, eval4, eval5 )\nweights = repeat( wi, ne )\ndf = DataFrame(\n    hcat(evaluators, evaluator_rankings, weights), \n    [\"evaluator\", \"criteria\", \"weight\"]\n    )\n\n30 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nevaluator\ncriteria\nweight\n\n\n\nAny\nAny\nAny\n\n\n\n\n1\neval1\nMileage\n0.336134\n\n\n2\neval1\nColor\n0.22409\n\n\n3\neval1\nPrice\n0.168067\n\n\n4\neval1\nSafety\n0.12605\n\n\n5\neval1\nReliability\n0.0896359\n\n\n6\neval1\nValue\n0.0560224\n\n\n7\neval2\nMileage\n0.336134\n\n\n8\neval2\nColor\n0.22409\n\n\n9\neval2\nSafety\n0.168067\n\n\n10\neval2\nReliability\n0.12605\n\n\n11\neval2\nValue\n0.0896359\n\n\n12\neval2\nPrice\n0.0560224\n\n\n13\neval3\nColor\n0.336134\n\n\n14\neval3\nValue\n0.22409\n\n\n15\neval3\nPrice\n0.168067\n\n\n16\neval3\nMileage\n0.12605\n\n\n17\neval3\nReliability\n0.0896359\n\n\n18\neval3\nSafety\n0.0560224\n\n\n19\neval4\nMileage\n0.336134\n\n\n20\neval4\nValue\n0.22409\n\n\n21\neval4\nColor\n0.168067\n\n\n22\neval4\nSafety\n0.12605\n\n\n23\neval4\nReliability\n0.0896359\n\n\n24\neval4\nPrice\n0.0560224\n\n\n25\neval5\nSafety\n0.336134\n\n\n26\neval5\nPrice\n0.22409\n\n\n27\neval5\nColor\n0.168067\n\n\n28\neval5\nReliability\n0.12605\n\n\n29\neval5\nMileage\n0.0896359\n\n\n30\neval5\nValue\n0.0560224\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Step 3: Calculate mean criteria weights\nCalculate mean criteria weights using split-apply-combine workflow.

    "title": "Never say never: Why I moved from local to state public health",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Since 1996, I served the City and County of San Francisco in numerous deputy health officer roles, eventually becoming the health officer in December 2010. I was born in San Francisco and grew up in the Mission District—a low-income, predominantly Latino community. My family immigrated from Nicaragua in the 1950s and the Mission was home to a large concentration of Central American immigrants. I was honored and proud to be the health officer of my city of birth.\nAt the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), local public health practice provided me with many unique challenges and opportunities. I was also the director of the Population Health Division that provided core public health services. I grew tremendously in my organizational and community leadership roles, and my partnerships with academic institutions such as UCSF and UC Berkeley School of Public Health fulfilled my nerdy inclinations. Over the years I worked with the California Department of Public Health on a variety of problems from communicable disease outbreaks to radiation concerns at the Hunter Points Naval Shipyard. However, I never—and I mean never!—imagined working for the state public health department—I wanted to stay close to the action; that is, local public health.\nBefore my health officer appointment, I had directed national CDC research and training centers on infectious disease emergency preparedness and response at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I had put that part of my career completely behind me and was more focused on broader public health challenges such as racial health inequities. I also developed a strong interest in leadership development, decision intelligence, and organizational performance improvement. The SFDPH became a laboratory for testing, learning, and teaching. I was professionally and intellectually fulfilled.\nThat all changed with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In December 2019, we started receiving news about an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Because of my training and expertise in communicable diseases, and my experience with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic flu in 2009, I was especially attuned to the evolving events.\nOn January 13, 2020, I med with Dr. Julie Stoltey, our communicable disease controller, and on January 21st we activated our Departmental Operations Center (DOC). We have been working non-stop since with very few days off. The pandemic not only disrupted our society and economy, it revealed and amplified pre-existing racial inequities. It also revealed the longstanding neglect of the public health infrastructure at all levels of government. Finally, people started to understand what is public health.\nMarch 15, 2020, a group of seven Bay Area health officers, led by Dr.Sara Cody, issued the first stay-at-home orders in the United States. We successfully prevented many cases, hospitalization, and deaths. Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of a long haul of fighting this relentless and unforgiving pandemic. Fortunately, the rapid development of effective vaccines meant real hope was around the corner, and that we would be transitioning into a recovery and rebuilding phase. This also means rebuilding the public health infrastructure for the 21st century.\nWhen the job announcement for the CDPH director and state public health officer was posted, I immediately applied. I could not pass up the opportunity to shape the future of public health services for a state of 40 million people, to advocate for the resources to rebuild our public health infrastructure, and to fight for social and racial equity and health on a larger stage. I was humbled and honored to be selected to serve in this position at this critical time in our history.\nI just completed seven weeks! I am exhausted, and at times overwhelmed and over extended! (So, what else is new!) My strongest impression working at CDPH is the enormous level of staff dedication, kindness, ingenuity, and passion for public service and science. I am inspired every single day! The CDPH staff are working 24/7 to protect and promote health and safety for the diverse counties and communities across the state. It’s a huge privilege to work more closely with health officials of the County Health Executives Association of California (CHEAC) and the Health Officers Association of California (HOAC), and with stakeholder and advocacy groups representing the diverse interests of California residents. They too are working just as hard and long to protect all of us.\nRebuilding public health requires everyone. I hope you will reach out to me and provide input and feedback on our and my performance, and how we can “become the best at getting better” in service to you.\nTo learn more about CDPH visit https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/About.aspx."

    "text": "Building trust\nIn organizations with high trust levels staff engage in honest, vigorous deliberations about important and sensitive topics, including strategy, budget cuts, ethics, equity, racism, discrimination, power, privilege, prejudice, interpersonal conflict, etc [2].\nThe word trust is used often but rarely defined. The word is thrown around as if everyone understands exactly what we mean. We attend countless meetings where “building trust” is emphasized. Building and restoring trust requires a thoughtful, systematic approach. To understand trust we must define it precisely. Trust is an aspect of relationships; it varies within and across relationships. Organizational trust researcher, Roger Mayer, defines trust as follows:\n\n“Trust is the willingness of a party [trustor] to be vulnerable to the actions of another party [trustee] based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party. … Making oneself vulnerable is taking a risk. Trust is not taking a risk per se, but rather it is a willingness to take risk” [3].\n\nIn short, trust is the willingness to be vulnerable to another party. Therefore, trust is a state of readiness to take risk in a relationship. Trust is the willingness to assume risk; behavioral trust (or a trusting action) is the assuming of risk. Our focus is on trust as a state of readiness (“willingness”). An organizational culture of trust is a culture where staff feel safe to tackle and vigorously debate the most challenging, sensitive topics in service of the organizational purpose.\nNot appreciated by many is that trust is an intuitive or deliberative decision. As an intuitive (gut) decision we experience trust as a feeling of safety. As a deliberative decision we experience trust as a confidence in our decision.\nAdditionally, we want others to trust us. Assuming good intentions, our general objective is to influence others to trust us, our teams, and our organization. Therefore, our job as managers is\n\nto be trustworthy,\nto behave in ways that inspire trust, and\nto design systems that promote a culture of trust.\n\nBuilding a culture of trust inspires better team collaboration, decision-making, execution, accountability, and performance. Here are The 8 Principles of Building Trust—these behaviors apply always, with anyone, and in any situation (think “CCCHARTS”):\n\nHave Character: with integrity, be ethical, honest, sincere, loyal\nBe Caring: be compassionate; ensure equity and dignity; be kind\nBe Competent: be capable, consistent, and continuously improving; seek frank and honest feedback from trusted critics\nBe Humble: cultivate general, intellectual, and cultural humility\nBe Accountable: own your influence and responsibilities; own your mistakes and failures, apologize and make amends\nBe Reliable: keep promises and commitments, and be on time\nBe Transparent (clarity): communicate intent [what], motive [why], agend [how: who, when, where], and expectations\nEnsure Safety (psychological, physical, and emotional): listen mindfully, respect boundaries, assume good intent, risk vulnerability, be curious—not judgmental\n\nCool tip: Fastest way to build trust [4]\n\nIf you need a fast, foolproof method to accelerate building trust with someone (e.g., your boss as the potential trustor), try this with genuine integrity and humility: “It’s really important to me that I earn your trust and confidence. Please tell me exactly what you need from me.” Ask for specifics and what success looks like. Write it down and review it with your potential trustor. Confirm mutual goals and expectations. Use the 8 Principles to deliver on your commitment(s).1\n\nDo not confuse trust with confidence. Trusting someone is not equivalent to having confidence in them. Trust requires a risk of vulnerability. A corollary: earning others’ complete trust almost always earns confidence in you, but earning others’ confidence (e.g., in your abilities) does not mean they also trust you (i.e., willingness to be vulnerable to your actions).\nThe trustor’s propensity to trust is the predisposition or general willingness to trust before any information about the trustee is considered. At one extreme, a very high propensity to trust can result in extending trust even when it is not warranted (“blind trust”). At the other extreme, a low propensity to trust can result in not extending trust even when it is warranted (“blind mistrust”).\n“Distrust” and “mistrust” have roughly the same meaning. Both mean lack of trust. But distrust is lack of trust based on experience or reliable information, while mistrust is often a general sense of unease toward someone or something."

    "text": "Courage and trust involve vulnerability\n\nCelebrating courage\nHumility and trust are based in human relationships and involve vulnerability. Brené Brown defines vulnerability “as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.” “Vulnerability is the core of all emotions and feelings. To feel is to be vulnerable [5]”. Any time someone risks vulnerability to get better, build trust, protect others, or behave ethically they are courageous! Therefore, we are surrounded by daily acts of unrecognized courage! Recognize and celebrate our courageous staff, clients, and communities!\n\n\nUnderstanding empathy and compassion\nWith sympathy I care about your suffering. With empathy I feel your suffering. With compassion I want to relieve your suffering. Be aware and mindful: because of our implicit biases we are more likely to empathize with people “like us” (e.g., tribalism). Instead, we endeavor to have empathy for those unlike us, and to have compassion towards those who are vulnerable or suffering, and to act in the face of our vulnerabilities—this is courage."

    "text": "Redefining what it means to be “smart”\nOur world is changing fast! Automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence—the Smart Machine Age (SMA)—are disrupting and displacing the workforce. Transdisciplinary teamwork is the new norm. People skills, creative and critical thinking, innovation, and improvement are more important now than ever!\nUnfortunately, our native cognitive abilities have not evolved at the same pace [2]. Our brain is wired to sense “dangers” and react based on perceived threats and emotions. Our brain is wired for efficiency: it defaults to personality traits, fast decisions via nonconscious schemas or learned mindsets. We resist new ideas that demand new cognitive effort. Our decisions are suboptimal due to cognitive biases: (a) protection of mindset, (b) personality and habits, (c) faulty reasoning, (d) automatic associations, (e) relative thinking, and (f) social influences [3].\nHumans are prone to defensiveness from our innate drive to protect our ego2 and to avoid our fears (vulnerability, uncertainty, risk, intellectual or emotional exposure, uninvited scrutiny). Science shows these behaviors impede creativity, critical and innovative thinking, reflective listening, and emotionally engaging others [1]. We mitigate these biases using brain science. We start with a new definition of “being smart” (“NewSmart”). We must embrace intellectual humility, honesty, and courage and redesign organizations for this new age. Professor Edward Hess’ NewSmart Humility has four interdependent components:\n\nNewSmart principles,\nHumility mindset,\nNewSmart behaviors, and\nNewSmart organization [1]."

NewSmart is a measure not of what you know or how much you know but of\n\nthe quality of your thinking, listening, collaborating, and learning;\nhow good you are at “not” knowing and decoupling your beliefs (not values) from your ego;\nhow good you are at being open to continually stress-testing your beliefs about how the world works;\nhow good you are at trying out new ideas and ways to accomplish your objectives and learning from those experiments” [1].\n\n“So what does the high-quality thinking, learning, and emotional engagement underlying NewSmart look like in practice?” The NewSmart principles are worth committing to memory:\n\n“I’m defined not by what I know or how much I know, but by the quality of my thinking, listening, relating, and collaborating.”\n“My mental models are not reality—they are only my generalized stories of how my world works.”\n“I’m not my ideas, and I must decouple my beliefs (not values) from my ego.”\n“I must be open-minded and treat my beliefs (not values) as hypotheses to be constantly tested and subject to modification by better data.”\n“My mistakes and failures are opportunities to learn.”\n\nThis Table compares the “old smart” to the NewSmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld smart\nNewSmart\n\n\n\n\nI know\nI’m good at not knowing\n\n\nI tell\nI ask\n\n\nDefend my views\nImprove my views\n\n\nSeek confirmation\nSeek truth\n\n\nClose mind\nOpen mind\n\n\nInsecure if beliefs are challenged\nInsecure if beliefs are NOT challenged\n\n\nMistakes are bad\nMistakes are learning opportunities\n\n\nPerfectionism\nLearning"

    "section": "The NewSmart behaviors",
    "text": "The NewSmart behaviors\nThe NewSmart and Humility mindsets drive behaviors that are supported and improved with evidence-based skills. Hess clusters them into four behavioral categories:\n\nQuieting Ego,\nManaging Self (one’s thinking and emotions),\nReflective Listening, and\nOtherness (emotionally connecting and relating).\n\n\n(a) Quieting Ego\n“Quieting Ego is how we can deliberately work to reduce our reflexive emotional defensiveness; have empathy and open-mindedness; engage in Reflective Listening; and proactively seek other people’s feedback and perspectives to stress-test our own thinking. Quieting Ego is a way of practicing and operationalizing Humility. To quiet our ego is to perceive others and the world without filtering everything through a self-focused lens and to tamp down on negative or self-protective”inner talk” that is driven consciously or subconsciously by our fears and insecurities” [1]. Quieting Ego starts with four evidence-based behaviors:\n\nmindfulness,\nmindfulness meditation,\ndaily Quiet Ego reminders, and\npracticing gratitude.\n\n\n\n(b) Managing Self (one’s thinking and emotions)\n“Managing Self—our emotions and thinking—aids us in engaging in the higher-level thinking and behavior required … . It’s necessary to remain open-minded and be willing to test our beliefs and modify our points of view if presented with better data. It’s also how we’re able to overcome our fear of mistakes in order to take ownership of them and learn from them, and helps us more effectively relate to and collaborate with others” [1].\n“Managing Self comes from the science of ‘self-regulation’ and ‘self-control,’ which are broad psychological concepts that mean to monitor and manage one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors” [1] and start with these practices:\n\nslowing down,\nmanaging thoughts,\nmanaging emotions, and\nemotional intelligence.\n\nFor managing thoughts, Hess’ “thinking toolbox” starts with familiar concepts from population health lean (PDSA problem-solving, root cause analysis, etc.). We also highly recommend reading Richard Nisbett’s Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking [5].\nFor managing emotions, “We’ve discussed how ego and fear are the two big learning inhibitors and explored our reflexive tendency as humans to be emotionally defensive and self-protective. We’ve discussed how negative emotions can undermine our behavior and thinking and how positive emotions can improve them. Stress, anger, and anxiety can cause narrow-mindedness and the fight-flee-or-freeze syndrome. … Positive emotions, on the other hand, have been scientifically linked not just to higher health and well-being but also to broader attention, open-mindedness, deeper focus, and more flexible thinking, all of which underlie creativity and innovative thinking. Positive emotions also improve decision making and general cognitive processing.”\nHess’ “managing emotions toolbox” includes effective techniques such as\n\npsychological distancing,\nreframing,\npositive memories,\npositive self-talk, and\nif-then implementation plans.\n\nSee Hess book for illustrative examples [1].\nEmotional intelligence (EI) is “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. … Sensitivity to other people’s emotions has been found to be a key to effective collaboration.” The EI model includes these abilities:\n\nPerceive and differentiate emotions in self and others.\nUse emotions to facilitate reasoning, aid judgment and memory processes, problem solve, communicate with others, and facilitate open-mindedness.\nUnderstand emotions by analyzing the emotions of yourself and others.\nManage emotions in self and others.\n\n\n\n(c) Reflective Listening\n“Reflective Listening is so important because it underlies all [other skills]. Why? Because your thinking and learning are limited by cognitive biases, emotional defensiveness, ego, and fear. You need, then, to truly listen to others to open your mind, push past your biases and mental models, and mitigate self-absorption in order to collaborate and build better relationships. [We know from] evidence that it’s hard for any of us to critique our own thinking and truly think critically. We’re just too wired to confirm what we already believe, and we feel too comfortable having a cohesive simple story of how our world works. We need to have thinking ‘partners’ who force us to confront those biases, and we need to listen to them” [1].\nReflective Listening includes these practices:\n\npreparing to listen reflectively,\nlistening with a Quiet Ego and an open mind, and\ninquiring with genuine curiosity, humility, and respect (humble inquiry).\n\nHere’s a preparation checklist for Reflective Listening:\n\nIs my mind clear? If not, take several deep, slow breaths.\nAm I calm emotionally? If not, take a few more deep breaths, focusing on breathing in for four seconds and very, very slowly breathing out for four seconds.\nSay to yourself a couple of times:\n\n\n“I am not my ideas.”\n“It’s not all about me.”\n“Don’t be defensive.”\n“Ask questions before telling.”\n“Don’t interrupt.”\n“Stay focused.”\n“Critique ideas, not people.”\n“Listen to understand, not to confirm.”\n\n\n\n(d) Otherness (emotionally connecting and relating)\nHess writes “We need others because we can’t think, innovate, or relate at our best alone. To relate to other people you first have to make a connection with them. It is by building a relationship over time that you build trust, and when you have caring trust, you have set the stage for the highest level of human engagement. … So how do you get better at connecting and relating? It’s quite obvious that connecting and relating to people is inhibited by arrogance, self-absorption, self-centeredness, not listening, closed-mindedness, lack of empathy, emotional defensiveness, and the ego protection and fear that flow from the Old Smart mental model. Accepting NewSmart and Humility as well as practicing Quieting Ego, Managing Self, and Reflective Listening lays the groundwork for relationship building with others.”\nOtherness behaviors include:\n\nusing the fives keys to connecting,\nbuilding trust and conveying caring,\npreparing for meetings,\nchoosing words wisely.\n\nThe five keys to connecting are\n\nbe present,\nbe genuine,\ncommunicate affirmation,\nlisten effectively, and\ncommunicate support.\n\nPrepare for meetings with this checklist:\n\nbe really present,\ngenuinely smile—a big smile,\nmake eye contact,\nbe positive,\nlisten reflectively,\nstay fully present, and\ndo no harm.\n\nChoose your words wisely: use “Yes, and” instead of “Yes, but” to build on the ideas of others; use “I believe” instead of “I think” to acknowledge your ideas are hypotheses open to critique and testing; use “I want to” instead of “I have to” and “I won’t” instead of “I can’t” to emphasize the power of choice."

    "section": "My history with R",
    "text": "My history with R\nFor 15 years, as volunteer adjunct faculty, I taught “Applied Epidemiology using R” at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I started teaching this course in the early 2000s when most people were not interested in R. Eventually R’s popularity grew, and so did my course enrollment. I taught basic R programming applied to epidemiologic concepts. Students worked on a project of their choosing. Because I had students from multiple disciplines, their projects were often very innovative and I learned a lot from them.\nOver the 15 years I witnessed the emergence of “data science” and students’ ingenuity and creativeness in their projects. Naturally, the course evolved too. I introduced Bayesian networks as a unifying framework to introduce probablistic dependence, causal graphs, and decision networks (for decision analysis) [1].\nI started dabbling in Python. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted my teaching because I was the health officer of San Francisco and director of the Population Health Division. Working on the pandemic response left me little time to conduct analyses or to learn Python.1\nI cannot remember when, but eventually I discovered Julia—a programming language designed for scientific computing with the intuition of Python or R, but with the speed of C++. I fell in love with Julia and I gave up on learning Python. I did not, and do not, have the time to maintain core competency in more than 1.5 programming languages.2 As I learned more Julia, I became convinced, that for me, learning Julia was a better long term investment than sticking with R.\nI use programming to explore or test my epidemiologic intuition, to learn new methods, and to visualize and analyze data. I have a personal interest in Bayesian networks, decision networks, causal inference, Markov decision processes, and agent-based modeling.3\nHere are some key Julia features that I believe epidemiologists will value:\n\nmultiple dispatch (see below)\ncomposite types\njust-in-time compiling\nspeed (very very fast)\ncommunity (mostly computer science, mathematics, engineering)\n1-based indexing like R and MATLAB (Python is 0-based indexing)\nCapabilities similar to dpylr in R 4, 5\nPipe operator similar to %&gt;% in R\ngeneral programming language (like Python)\n\nJulia enables more intuitive programming. For example, in R, we try to avoid loops because they are very inefficient. In Julia, loops are efficient because they compile before execution. This promotes programming that is more natural.\nBelow I demonstrate multiple dispatch with a trivial example. R is single dispatch."

    "text": "Multiple dispatch example in Julia\nI was the founding developer of the R ‘epitools’ package.6 I developed functions for basic epidemiologic analyses (eg, 2x2 tables), several from Rothman’s “Modern Epidemiology” textbook. For example, if I wanted to create a function to calculate an odds ratio for a 2x2 contingency table, the data could be provided in several ways:\n\nfour integer counts,\ntwo proportions, or\na 2x2 table (matrix)\ntwo vectors with categorical data\n\nIf I wanted to write one function to handle these possible data types as arguments, I would have to do a lot of processing and checking of data types in order to call the next function (nested or external). This requires much more work than is necessary. Let’s do this is Julia using multiple dispatch.\nIn 2003, we published a study that provided evidence that drinking unfiltered municipal tap water was associated with developing cryptosporidiosis among patients with advanced HIV disease [2]. Here is a contingency table from this paper.\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\n12\n6\n\n\nIntermediate\n35\n64\n\n\nLowest\n2\n29\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate the unadjusted odds ratio comparing the highest exposure category to the lowest exposure category. Here is the 2x2 table for this calculation.\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\n12\n6\n\n\nLowest\n2\n29\n\n\n\nFor an appropriately structured table, for example,\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\na\nb\n\n\nLowest\nc\nd\n\n\n\nthe odds ratio is the cross-product:\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a d}{b c}\n\\]\nFor a case-control design, the odds ratio is the ratio of the exposure odds.\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{p_1/(1 - p_1)}{p_0/(1 - p_0)}\n\\]\nWe will create three functions that can receive three different types of arguments to calculate an odds ratio.\n\nfour integer counts,\ntwo proportions, or\na 2x2 table (matrix)\n\nThe catch is that the three functions will have the same name: oddsratio. This is possible in Julia because of multiple dispatch.

The CDPH directorate (leadership) has established three strategic priorities to drive CDPH’s lean transformation:\n\nBecome a learning, healing, and impactful organization\n\nDeploy lean with Objectives and Key Results (Figure 1)1\nBecome trauma informed and responsive\nPromote equity, antiracism and health equity\n\nDevelop our people\n\nEnsure core public health competencies\nSupport personal professional development\n\nTackle key public health challenges\n\nThe Future of Public Health Initiative\nBehavioral health promotion (especially youth)\nCommunity and Population Health Improvement\nEmergency readiness and pandemic recovery\nClimate action and community resilience\n\n\nAt CDPH, we envision having 4000+ problem solvers focused on incremental and breakthrough continuous improvement and innovation using lean thinking and practice. Lean thinking and practice is “systematically developing people to solve problems and consuming the fewest possible resources while continuously improving processes to provide value to community members and prosperity to society.”2\nEvery health organization, program, and team should be lean. These six elements make up the CDPH lean operating system:\n\nRespect for people (staff, community, client, patient, customer)\nContinuous improvement (improvement kata)\nScientific thinking, problem solving, and innovation (A3 thinking)\nManagement by Objectives (goals) and Key Results (measures) (OKRs)\nBeing agile, adaptive, and responsive to meet challenges and opportunities\nElimination of waste and undesired variability in inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes\n\nThese six components are required and if one is missing organizational effectiveness and mission will suffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEvery health organization, program, and team should be a lean. … These six components are required and if one is missing organizational effectiveness and mission will suffer.\n\n\nFor this blog posting I am highlighting Objectives and Key Results (Figure 1).

We have\n\nObjectives (goals or subgoals)\nKey Results (measures of progress and success)\nActivities (tasks; project management milestones)\n\nBy intention, OKRs focuses on the first two. Obviously, activities are critical and important; that is why project management is essential to completing a project on time, within budget, and with high quality.\nCompleting a project is not the same as accomplishing your goals—do not confuse them. A good project manager makes these distinctions and incorporates good goal-setting (OKRs) into project management practice.\nHere is an acronym to help you remember: OKRA (like the vegetable!).\n\nO = Objectives (goals—desired future states)\nKR = Key Results (metrics—measures of progress and success)\nA Activities (tasks—project management)\n\nWhen you are asked to provide OKRs, provide the OKRs and not only a long list of current and completed activities. For example, a project management milestone (“building a bridge”) is not the same as an Objective (“goal of improving commute transportation”) and Key Results (lowering commuting costs, reducing commute times, improving commuting experience, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProject management milestones are not OKRs unless they are explicitly designed to be OKRs.

    "text": "Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) in detail\nGoal setting and tracking are at the center of all performance or improvement frameworks (eg, planning, project management, lean, Results-Based Accountability [RBA], Incident Command System [ICS]). Because of its central importance, we are using a best practice for goal setting and tracking called Objectives and Key Results (Figure 1). OKRs is an updated version of “management by objectives” (around since the 1950s) and is used by organizations like Google, the Gates Foundation, and many others.\nFor your top priorities, answer two questions:\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish? (Objectives). Good Objectives are significant, concrete, action-oriented, and inspirational.\nHow do we measure progress and success? (Key Results). Good Key Results are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic, and measurable and verifiable.\n\nThat’s it! Then, meet at a regular cadence to track progress on Key Results, and adjust activities to achieve your Objectives. To learn more, see https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started.\nKey Results are always connected to specific Objectives. Key Results are necessary and sufficient to accomplish the Objective. Objectives are the WHAT and Key Results are the HOW.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart RL\n  kr1.1([Key Result 1.1]) --&gt; o1(Objective 1)\n  kr1.2([Key Result 1.2]) --&gt; o1\n  kr2.1([Key Result 2.1]) --&gt; o2(Objective 2)\n  kr2.2([Key Result 2.2]) --&gt; o2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOKRs do not replace other frameworks. OKRs is a goal setting best practice, and goal setting is part of all planning, implementation, and improvement frameworks (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Goal setting is core to all planning, implementation, and improvement frameworks. OKRs or Objectives and Key Results is a best practice for setting, tracking, and achieving your most important goals. OKRs was popularized by John Doerr’s best-selling book “Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.”\n\n\nGoal-setting is at the core of many frameworks:\n\nResults-Based Accountability (RBA)\nIncident Command System (ICS)\nLean management system\nProject management\nPolicy development\nCollective Impact\nPlanning\n\nOKRs supercharge your ability to set and achieve audacious goals by accelerating your FACTS:\n\nF \\(\\rightarrow\\) Focus\nA \\(\\rightarrow\\) Alignment\nC \\(\\rightarrow\\) Commitment\nT \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tracking\nS \\(\\rightarrow\\) Stretching\n\n\nThree Kinds of OKRs\nOKRs are a communication tool that describe what success looks like. To reach your Objective, what do you need to accomplish? And how far do you need to stretch your efforts this cycle to get there?\nOKRs are one of three types:\n\nCommitted OKR: Though still a stretch, we must achieve 100% in the next cycle.\nAspirational OKR: A significant stretch in the next cycle; typically only 70% of these KRs will be met.\nLearning OKR: What you want to learn in the next cycle.\n\n\n\nWhat is a good Objective?\nA good Objective is\n\nsignificant,\nconcrete,\naction-oriented,\ninspirational.\n\nIt does not have metrics; it is your destination! Here are additional questions to ask:\n\nIs the Objective a meaningful change?\nIs the Objective an inspiring change?\nIs the Objective an audacious change?\nIs each one specific enough, articulating a clear direction?\nDo they inspire action with verbs and avoid passive language?\nAre they all concise? Or could you say them in a simpler way?\n\n\n\nWhat are good Key Results?\nGood Key Results are\n\nspecific and time-bound,\naggressive yet realistic, and\nmeasurable and verifiable.\n\nPhrase each of your Key Results as an input, process, output, or outcome.\n\nInputs \\(\\rightarrow\\) financial, material, or human resources\nProcesses \\(\\rightarrow\\) activities that transform inputs into outputs\nOutputs \\(\\rightarrow\\) delivery of products or services\nOutcomes \\(\\rightarrow\\) change in knowledge, behaviors, skills, conditions, etc.\n\nWe have control of inputs, processes, and outputs, but usually only influence on outcomes.\nKey Results based on outcomes are more meaningful, but more difficult to measure and track.\nLook for leading indicators are predictive and provide early warning of trouble.\nPair quantity KRs with quality KRs\nDetermine if your KR is a hold, an increment, or a leap\n\nHold \\(\\rightarrow\\) Keep getting the same results.\nIncrement \\(\\rightarrow\\) Improve what’s working today.\nLeap \\(\\rightarrow\\) Make a big step forward.\n\nThe Figure 3 (Table) summarizes Key Results and includes the Results-Based Accountability (RBA) framework. RBA is an epidemiologic framework that distinguishes program versus population results and is commonly used for collective impact approaches.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Key Results are metrics that are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic, and measurable and verifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nObjectives and Key Results (OKRs)\nFor your top priorities, answer two questions:\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish?

Below are my comments delivered at the commencement and thanks to the SPH community.\n\nCommencement comments (starts at 58:57)\n\n\nI want to express my enormous gratitude to the UC Berkeley SPH community for selecting me as the “2021 Alumnus of the Year.” For me, this is a tremendous honor. The SPH has a very special place in my heart\nI graduated in 2000 with a Doctor of Public Health degree. From 2003 to 2010, at the SPH I directed a CDC center on infectious disease emergency preparedness and response. Of course, the Feds cut all our funding, so in 2011, I became the Health Officer of San Francisco.\nOn January 9, 2020, the WHO announced a mysterious coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China. On January 21st, I activated our public health emergency response, and the same day the CDC confirmed the first coronavirus case in the US. On Sunday, March 15th, I woke up not realizing that the very next day, March 16th, I, along with six Bay Area health officers, would be issuing the first regional stay-at-home orders in the United States. California followed on March 19th, and New York City on March 22nd.\nThat decision, came together with lightning speed because we had developed a relationship based on trust, respect, and universal values. Dr. Monica Sharma, former director of leadership development at the United Nations, defines universal values as values that apply to every person on earth, leaving no one behind. She learned that embodying and promoting the values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility were the most effective: they enabled people to come together, transcend differences, find common ground, and solve complex problems—in our case—could we dodge a public health catastrophe through swift public health action?\nOur team had embraced what Dr. Sharma calls radical transformational leadership—leading change from the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility to transform self, people, systems and cultures towards equity, antiracism, and sustainable results.\nEmbodying humility opens your heart and mind to listening deeply to opposing points of view; it accelerates group learning and problem solving. With humility you come to appreciate and value multiple truths. You embrace curiosity over certainty, inquiry before advocacy, and discernment over judgment.\nToday, as you embark on your public health careers, I hope you will become radical transformational leaders, and embody and promote the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility in every interaction, in every conversation, and in every decision.\nThank you!"

    "text": "Letter of gratitude to SPH community\nMarch 28, 2021\nDear UC Berkeley SPH family,\nI want to express my enormous gratitude for selecting me as the 2021 Alum of the Year. For me, this is a tremendous honor. UC Berkeley SPH has a very special place in my heart. I grew up in San Francisco’s Mission District. My family immigrated from Nicaragua in the 1950s. My father completed high school and my mother completed sixth grade. He worked as a cook and dishwasher and she as a seamstress. When I was 5 my mom became a single parent raising four children. She became my role model and moral compass.\nI was accepted to UC Berkeley at the age of 17 through the Affirmative Action and Education Opportunity Programs. Unfortunately, I dropped out after two quarters because I was struggling academically. I did not have the academic preparation of other students. I enrolled in SF State, improved my study skills, got my grades up and returned to UC Berkeley in 1981 to study molecular biology. As an undergraduate I enrolled in a SPH course on cancer epidemiology. I was hooked! I knew that public health and epidemiology would always be a part of my career.\nIn medical school, I received my MPH degree. After my primary care internal medicine residency and infectious disease fellowship at UCSF, I received my Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) from the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I had the privilege to learn from the best epidemiology and biostatistics professors in the nation. I studied everything from advanced biostatistics to mathematical demography and modeling.\nSince 2003 I have been a voluntary lecturer at the UCB SPH teaching “Applied Epidemiology Using R,” even after I became health officer of San Francisco in 2011. When I started teaching this course few were interested in R. I had the privilege to see firsthand computational thinking and data science explode in innovation. Through their innovative class projects, my students were teaching me more than I was teaching them. I experienced what I call “population health data science” (descriptive, predictive, causal inference, modeling, and optimization methods). I get to bring all of this innovation into my public health practice!\nAs public health officials we make daily decisions in the face of uncertainty, time constraints, competing objectives, and limited information. This culminated with the Bay Area health officers issuing shelter-in-place orders on March 16, 2020. All of my public health decisions and public health orders have been influenced by the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.\nI am indebted to you all—students, professors, and staff! You have had a real hand in my public health career and actions.\nThat is why being selected the 2021 University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health Alum of the Year is the most valued honor I could ever receive.\nThank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nWith tremendous gratitude,\nTomás Aragón\nUC Berkeley Class of 1983 (AB, Molecular Biology)\nUC Berkeley School of Public Health, Class of 2000 (DrPH, Epidemiology)"

It’s an honor to be here today to present on the State of Public Health in California.\nAt CDPH, our mission is “to advance the health and well-being of California’s diverse people and communities” with the vision that all Californians enjoy “healthy communities with thriving families and individuals.”\nHealth is not the absence of disease or injury—it’s a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. The Institute of Medicine defined public health as “what we, as a society, collectively do to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy.”\nPublic health is OUR collective endeavor to protect, promote, and improve the health of our communities.\nUnfortunately, the field of public health is often misunderstood and sometimes confused with health care which is the provision of medical services to an enrolled population.1\nFor comparison, here are the four pillars of the public health approach:\nWell, what have we accomplished collectively? Over the last 20 years, public health has contributed to significant improvements in health and well-being for all groups in California. For example,\nDespite declines in mortality for all groups in California, significant racial and ethnic health disparities continue. For example,\nPublic health works to reduce these disparities by informing policies that address the underlying social, environmental, and behavioral drivers of health, and by regulating selected sectors with high impacts on health; for example, we licensed, certify, and inspect over 10,000 health facilities across the state, including over 1200 skilled nursing facilities and over 400 hospitals.\nEquity is a foundational guiding principle in public health. Based on need, every Californian should have the resources and opportunities to be healthy and thrive. This requires prioritizing investments in communities with continuing health inequities.\nToday, California faces some of the toughest public health challenges in decades. These challenges include COVID-19, chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s, mental illness and substance use disorder, firearm-related death and injury, and health impacts from climate change and extreme weather. CDPH is building capacity to tackle these public health priorities.\nClimate change is a major force impacting the public’s health, affecting all aspects of our health and well-being—affecting access to clean air, food, water, shelter, and physical safety.\nLife expectancy steadily increased for 20 years prior to 2020, but due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a sharp drop in life expectancy.\nThrough OUR collective actions we provided testing, vaccination, treatment, and public health guidance. This led to significant reductions in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths between 2020 and 2021. In 2022, COVID-19 dropped to the third leading cause of death.4 Now in 2023 we have reached the lowest levels since the pre-pandemic period—enabling activities of daily life to resume more safely.\nCOVID-19 will remain with us for the foreseeable future, including the uncertain burden of “long COVID.” Using lessons learned from the pandemic, the California SMARTER plan enables us to manage COVID-19 today and prepare for future surges and variants, as well as respond to emerging infectious diseases.6\nLast year, CDPH leveraged the COVID response infrastructure and the SMARTER Plan to respond to the mpox outbreak. We were able to activate systems for surveillance, vaccination, and treatment to highly impacted communities.\nAgain, at the end of 2022, we leveraged the COVID response infrastructure to address the simultaneous surge of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. We tracked disease levels and their real-time and projected impacts on the healthcare system. CDPH provided data to local partners and policymakers to guide the response to this “tripledemic.”\nThe Governor’s 2023 Budget Proposal continues investments to support the state’s efforts to protect against COVID-19 and other public health threats.\nCalifornia’s population is growing older. By 2030, 1 in 4 Californians will be over 60 years old.8\nIschemic heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease continue to be the top leading causes of death for Californians.4\nCardiovascular diseases contributed to the most deaths in 2021. This condition group includes ischemic heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive heart disease, all of which are in the top five leading causes of death.\nDeaths from Alzheimer’s disease have more than doubled since 2000, and about 1 in 10 adults in California experience subjective cognitive decline or memory loss.9 CDPH collaborates with stakeholders to support the Master Plan for Aging8 to prevent and prepare for the growing number of Alzheimer’s cases and forge a path forward for families. Several conditions other than COVID-19 show substantial increases in death rates over the past two years. These include deaths related to alcohol, road injury, and drug overdose. By far, drug overdose has caused the largest increase, with deaths increasing by over 200% between 2011 and 2021.4\nMany public health challenges start early in life among children, youth, and young adults, impacting their life course trajectory of physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being. Children and youth are dealing with unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 2022, almost 38,000 of California’s children under 18 had lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-19.11 This type of loss has long-term health consequences and contributes to Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. Toxic stress over time from ACEs can alter brain development and affect the body’s response to stress. ACEs are linked to chronic health problems, mental health issues, and substance misuse in adulthood. In California, about 6 in 10 adults report experiencing at least one ACE before the age of 18. [cdphcdss2017-aces-in-ca-report-web]\nPublic Health works with the Department of Social Services and the Office of the Surgeon General to promote policies that prevent ACEs and build safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments through programs like home visiting.\nIn the United States, mental health conditions affect more than half of people over their lifetime and contribute to worse overall health and risk of death by suicide.12\nUntreated mental health problems or substance use and addiction can result in injury and premature death.\nThe Governor’s proposed budget demonstrates steadfast commitment to advancing the health and well-being of all of California’s communities, while prioritizing the most vulnerable, through critical investments in the behavioral health system, social safety net programs, and the public health infrastructure.\nThe Budget provides support for core public health infrastructure. Through the Future of Public Health Initiative,15 the State invested $300 million to modernize state ($99.6M) and local ($200.4M) public health infrastructure and to transition to a more resilient system. Centered on equity, we are building our capacity and capabilities in long-term strategic planning and policy development; workforce development; data modernization, data science, and decision intelligence; emergency preparedness and response; health care partnerships to improve population health management; community engagement and partnerships; and recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve. This funding is already at work, with many new staff hired across the state to support this transformation.\nCDPH is an agency with over 220 programs and 4000 staff, but PUBLIC HEALTH is what WE do collectively to ensure the conditions in which every Californian can be healthy and thrive.\nThank you for your leadership and support!!!"

    "text": "2 Book highlights\n\n2.1 Chapter 1 Introduction\nMy blog posting “My Journey from R to Julia” is a good summary of what is covered in the Introduction. I will cover just one item—execution speed, and compare it to R.\nWe will construct a for loop summation of a random sequence of integers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) that are sampled without replacment.1 Here is the correct answer as a reference:\n\n## In Julia\njulia&gt;  sum(1:1_000_000_000)\n500000000500000000\n\n## In R\n&gt; options(digits=20)\n&gt; sum(1:1000000000)\n[1] 5.000000005e+17\n\nBy default, R would give the wrong answer (not shown) because it uses 64-bit floating point numbers.2 To get the correct answer we need 64-bit integers. For this I used the bit64 R package to get the correct answer (below).\n\n\n&gt; require(\"bit64\")\n&gt; n = 1000000000\n&gt; samp = sample(1:n, n, replace=FALSE)\n&gt; sum_n = function(x){\n+     s = as.integer64(0)\n+     for (i in x){\n+         s = s + i\n+     }\n+     s\n+ }\n&gt; system.time(x &lt;- sum_n(samp))\n     user    system   elapsed \n11094.792   101.378 11201.145 \n&gt; x\ninteger64\n[1] 500000000500000000\n\nTo get the correct answer in R, the execution time was about 11,095 seconds. Okay, let’s try Julia.\n\n\njulia&gt; using StatsBase, BenchmarkTools\njulia&gt; n = 1_000_000_000;\njulia&gt; samp = sample(1:n, n, replace=false);\njulia&gt; function sum_n(x)\n           s = 0\n               for i in x\n                   s = s + i\n               end\n               return s\n       end\nsum_n (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia&gt; @btime sum_n(samp)\n  158.118 ms (1 allocation: 16 bytes)\n500000000500000000\n\nIn Julia, it took about 158 milliseconds. R is about 70,168 times slower than Julia!3\nConclusion: Compared to R, Julia can handle large for loops for summation and give an accurate answer fast. To add integers correctly using a for loop, R requires using the bit64 package but is 70,168 time slower than Julia. With R, we are taught to avoid for loops — now you know why. However, a for loop is a workhorse tool that we want available to us; hence, this a huge advantage of Julia.\nTo see more benchmarks visit Which programming language is fastest?.\n\n\n2.2 2 Getting started with Julia\n\n2.2.1 Basic data types\nIf you are familar with R or Python, you will feel comfortable with Julia. Here is a character:\n\n## character; notice single quotation marks\n'a'\n\n'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)\n\n\nA string is a collection of characters:\n\n## string; notice double quotation marks\n\"Hello World\"\n\n\"Hello World\"\n\n\nAn array is a collection in brackets. A vector is a 1-dimensional array. Commas are used to create a vector. By default, the vector is displayed vertically, but it is not a “column vector”.\n\n## vector\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nTo display horizontally use the show function.4\n\n## vector\nshow([1, 2, 3])\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nA matrix is a two-dimensional array. Numbers separated by spaces create one row of a matrix. This is not a vector.\n\n## matrix\n[1 2 3 4]\n\n1×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3  4\n\n\nMatrix rows separated by a semi-colon creates a multi-row matrix:\n\n## matrix\n[1 2 3 4; 6 7 8 9]\n\n2×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3  4\n 6  7  8  9\n\n\nThe size function returns the dimensions of an array. Previously, we learned that a vector is a 1-dimensional array.\n\nsize([1, 2, 3])\n\n(3,)\n\n\nWe see this vector is 1-dimensional ((3,)); in contrast,\n\nsize([1 2 3])\n\n(1, 3)\n\n\nthis is a (1, 3) matrix or 2-dimensional.\nA tuple is a collection in parentheses, and commas separate the elements. Above, the size function returned a tuple. Tuples are immutable; their elements cannot be changed. Immutable objects increase computational speed.\n\n## tuple\n(1, 2, 3)\n\n(1, 2, 3)\n\n\nTuple elements can be named.\n\n## named tuple\n(four = 4, five = 5, six = 6)\n\n(four = 4, five = 5, six = 6)\n\n\nThe assigment operation (=) is used to bind data values to a variable. Binding in Julia is similar to binding in Python, but not in R.\n\nx = [1, 2]\ny = x\ny\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n\n\nIf we change an element in x, the same change occurs in y because same array was binded to the variables x and y.\n\nx[2] = 99\n## notice that y changes also\ny\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 99\n\n\nThis is not the case in R:\n\n&gt; x = c(1, 2)\n&gt; y = x\n&gt; x[2] = 99\n&gt; x\n[1]  1 99\n&gt; y\n[1] 1 2\n\nTo replicate the R experience in Julia we assign a copy of x to y.\n\nx = [1, 2]\ny = copy(x)\nx[2] = 99\nx\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n 99\n\n\n\ny\n\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Basic functions\nIn my blog posting “My Journey from R to Julia” I demonstrated how to create a simple function to calculate the odds ratio using 3 methods with multiple dispatch.5 I will use the function that calculates the odds ratio using the cross-product of 4 integers, and build a more useful function to illustrate some features of Julia.\nFor an appropriately structured table, for example,\n\n\n\nExposure\nDisease\nNo disease\n\n\n\n\nYes\na\nb\n\n\nNo\nc\nd\n\n\n\nthe odds ratio is the cross-product:\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a d}{b c}\n\\]\nHere is a simple Julia function to calculate the odds ratio:\n\nfunction oddsratio(a, b, c, d)\n    or = (a * d) / (b * c)\n    return or\nend \n\noddsratio (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBecause this is a simple function, it can also be created in an abbreviated form:\n\noddsratio(a, b, c, d) = (a * d) / (b * c)\n\noddsratio (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nHere is data from a case-control study [2]:\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\n12\n6\n\n\nLowest\n2\n29\n\n\n\nLet’s test the oddsratio function by passing four integers from our 2x2 table.\n\noddsratio(12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n29.0\n\n\nThe function arguments, a, b, c, and d are called positional arguments and are always required in the correct order.\nWe now add a keyword argument which is optional. Keyword arguments are separated from the positional arguments by a semicolon (;). Any argument, positional or keyword, can be assigned a default value. We’ll create oddsratio2function to calculate a confidence interval using the Normal approximation. The keyword argument will have a default confidence level of 0.95.\n\nusing Distributions # to access standard normal distribution \nfunction oddsratio2(a, b, c, d; level = 0.95)\n    zv = quantile(Normal(), 0.5*(1 + level))\n    est = (a * d) / (b * c)\n    log_or = log(est)\n    se_log_or = sqrt((1/a) + (1/b) + (1/c) + (1/d))\n    lcl = exp(log_or - zv * se_log_or)\n    ucl = exp(log_or + zv * se_log_or)\n    return (\n        or = est, \n        confint = (lcl, ucl), \n        level = level\n    )\nend \n\noddsratio2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBy default, oddsratio2 will calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\noddsratio2(12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n(or = 29.0, confint = (5.110695577009899, 164.55685675804662), level = 0.95)\n\n\nI can also calculate 99% confidence intervals:\n\nresults = oddsratio2(12, 6, 2, 29; level = 0.99)\n\n(or = 29.0, confint = (2.9619778898301936, 283.93189661797715), level = 0.99)\n\n\nAnd we can index elements of the named tuple.\n\nresults.confint\n\n(2.9619778898301936, 283.93189661797715)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Anonymous functions\nFunctions can be arguments to functions. For example, we will create a times_two function and past it to other functions.\n\ntimes_two(x) = 2 * x\nmap(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  2\n  4\n 16\n\n\n\nsum(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n22\n\n\n\nusing StatsBase\nmean(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n7.333333333333333\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass the times_two function as an anonymous function; that is, a function without a name.\n\nmap(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  2\n  4\n 16\n\n\n\nsum(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n22\n\n\n\nmean(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n7.333333333333333\n\n\nWe can even calculate the odds ratio as an anonymous function.\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), (12, 6, 2, 29)...)\n\n29.0\n\n\nNotice I used a trick. By default, the map function maps and executes a function with elements of a collection (eg, [1 ,2, 8]). However, for the odds ratio calcuation, I need to map the arguments (a, b, c, d) to their values (12, 6, 2, 29), then calculate the odds ratio. Therefore, I used the splat operator (...) to break up the collection of values so that they could be mapped to their arguments first. Although I used a tuple (12, 6, 2, 29), an array also works [12, 6, 2, 29].\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), [12, 6, 2, 29]...)\n\n29.0\n\n\nThe splat operator (...) converts [12, 6, 2, 29] to 12, 6, 2, 29 which is very convenient if the vector is very large. In this case, with only four integers, I could have passed the integers without the splat operator.\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), 12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n29.0\n\n\nChapter 1 also covers other topics including loops, conditional expressions, and scoping. Chapters 3 to 7 cover practical tools for processing and managing data in Julia. I will focus the remainder of this book review on data frames.\n\n\n\n2.3 Chapters 8–13: Working with data frames\nThe author is a lead developer of the DataFrames.jl Julia package. So in these chapters he covers this package thoroughly and you will not be disappointed.

Every explicit decision we make is the realization of causal thinking. You will be surprised to learn that the rigorous study of causality as a science is relatively new in comparison to the disciplines of statistics and probability. The history of the Causal Revolution will surprise, inspire, entertain, and—at times—shock you! Below is my 5-star Amazon review of the Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect (which became an Amazon “Best Seller” within the first week of its release!).\n“Wow! I am a physician epidemiologist with a doctorate in epidemiology and I teach computational epidemiology (with R) at UC Berkeley. I had the opportunity to study biostatistics from the best professors at UC Berkeley School of Public Health (Steve Selvin, Nicolas Jewell, Richard Brand, and many more). The field of causal inference was just beginning to take off with biostatisticians piloting the plane (Mark van der Laan, Nicolas Jewell, etc.). I avoided a rigorous study of causal inference but eventually came around after studying Bayesian networks (pioneered by Judea Pearl) for decision analysis. Judea Pearl’s Bayesian networks and causal graphs connects the fields of statistics, epidemiology, decision and computer sciences in a profoundly elegant way. His work empowers and expands the potential of”big data.” This is the first book written for the general public on this topic. It will have a huge impact. Causality and causal reasoning is at the core of everything we see, do, and imagine. He provides a graphical tool (causal graphs) for encoding expert knowledge (including community wisdom and experience). Anyone—yes, anyone—can learn the basics. For additional rigor, there are structural causal models (functional equations). I now consider it “data scientific malpractice” to be designing studies, analyzing data, and adjusting for confounders without using causal models. Human brains are wired to resist new paradigms. Be intellectually wise and humble and read this book–you will not regret it!”"

    "title": "How emotions are made: The secret life of the brain",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Most of what we know about our emotions (and how our brains work) is just plain wrong—and sometimes harmful! Myth: our emotions are hard-wired by evolution in our “limbic” (“reptilian”) brain and emotions are “triggered.” Myth: across the globe humans have universal facial expressions for core emotions (e.g., joy causes smiling). Myth: we control our emotions with our “rational” (neocortex) brain. Myth: the amygdala is the “fear center” of the brain. Myth: we can learn to read others’ emotions with reliability. Myth: seeing is believing. Myth: we cannot go wrong trusting our “gut” feeling.\nReading Lisa Feldman Barrett’s How Emotions are Made: The secret life of the brain was transformative. Our emotions, brain, and body do not function as depicted by brain science myths that have been debunked, but persist because scientists, health professionals, and the “emotion,” “emotional-intelligence,” and “brain science” industries are not current with the latest neuroscience. This book will set you on the right course.\nAt birth, the brain is a blank slate awaiting “wiring instructions” from a caregiver. Every second we are alive the brain processes “big data” of sensory input from our body (through interoception) and from the external world (through our senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Through evolution, humans solved a neurobio-engineering problem: how do we efficiently procure and balance energy and accumulate learnings on how to survive and procreate. The brain evolved into a predictive learning machine. The memories we accumulate through experiences become the predictions (“hypotheses” or “priors”) that the brain compares to new sensory input (“evidence”). The gap between prediction and sensory input is prediction error. If the prediction error is small or negligible the brain accepts the prediction, thereby saving cognitive energy expenditure. If the prediction error is large (e.g., cognitive dissonance), the brain must choose either to accept the prediction (cognitively and energy efficient, so our brain strongly prefers this), or to learn (cognitively and energy inefficient, so our brain strongly resists this).\nThe brain must make meaning of this sensory input in order to prepare for what the body needs to do next (based on prior experiences) to survive, etc. The brain prepares the body to respond through our nervous, cardiovascular, immune, endrocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Emotions are the on-the-spot meanings the brain gives to these external and internal sensory input (bodily sensations). “In other words, emotions are your brain’s best guess of how you should feel in the moment. Emotions aren’t wired into your brain like little circuits; they’re made on demand. As a result, you have more control over your emotions than you might think.”1\nAll of this happens automatically at a nonconscious level: that is why it “feels” like our emotions are “triggered.” In fact, our emotions are constructed in the moment based on:\nThe implications of understanding this evolution-designed engineering achievement are huge! How the brain processes the big data of sensory input also provides lessons on how we should process the new big data we are accumulating in the “cloud.” (Hint: read my book review of Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect.)"

    "text": "Designing an emotionally fulfilling life\nEven today, we are taught, incorrectly, that emotions are hardwired by evolution and that we should “control” (i.e., suppress), accept (i.e., embrace), or release emotions. For example, someone or something “triggers” an emotion and a stress response (“fight-flight-freeze”) in us, and we can use mindfulness to notice, acknowledge, and “release” this emotion. Yes, mindfulness works; however, mindfulness is much more powerful when we understand that emotions are acutually constructed rathered than “triggered.”\nWe have the power to design and build an emotionally fulfilling life by the experiences we choose to have and the cognitive and motor memories we encode in our brains. This explains how “doing” rewires the brain! Interestingly, Buddhism3 practices (e.g., mindfulness meditation) align nicely with this modern scientific understanding of brain and emotions. For example, Dr. Barrett studies and describes how Buddhism can strengthen interpersonal relationships and improve your brain and body health.4\nMindfulness promotes stillness, awareness, and being in the moment without judgment or expectation. Then, we can exercise curiosity about what contributed or is contributing to our feelings (affect) and emotions (meaning). This is critical because our brains are quick to draw false conclusions to save cognitive energy rather than to “get it right.” Interestingly, the more vocabulary we have to describe feelings and emotions, the more ability we have to recognize these in ourselves and others. This is called emotional granularity and is the actual basis of emotional intelligence.5\nDr. Barrett’s How Emotions are Made covers many practical applications of this emerging science, including mitigating implicit racial bias."

Does everyone experience happiness, sadness and anxiety the same way? What are emotions anyway? For the past 25 years, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett has mapped facial expressions, scanned brains and analyzed hundreds of physiology studies to understand what emotions really are. She shares the results of her exhaustive research—and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.”\n\n\n\n\nSee reading list for above TED talk.\n\n\n3 (TED): Cultivating Wisdom: The Power of Mood\n“Do you believe that what you see influences how you feel? Actually, the opposite is true: What you feel—your affect—influences what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett shares the groundbreaking discovery that you experience the world through affect-colored glasses. She also reveals how affect can be a source of wisdom that helps you to make better, wiser choices”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 How Emotions are Made (Cinematic Lecture)\nEmotions don’t happen to you. They are made by your predictive brain, in specific situations: a brain that feels affect and makes concepts absorbed from your life experience while conversing with your body + the world around you.\nThis cinematic lecture by Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett is based off her book of the same name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLFB’s website (includes numerous academic lectures)\nHere is her website with a wealth of material: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/."

    "section": "The 10 Lessons",
    "text": "The 10 Lessons\nThe 10 lessons do not completely correspond to the chapters. In the coming days I will be highlighting under each lesson what I found interesting and informative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson One (Chapter 1: From Tragedy to Possibility)\n\n\n\nThe Covid war is a story of how our wondrous scientific knowledge has run far, far ahead of the organized human ability to apply that knowledge in practice.\n\n\nThe mindset required to respond to the Covid pandemic is to treat it like fighting a war. In a war we face four challenges (p. 5):\n\n“Prevent and warn. Size up the danger, engage citizens, and track the enemy.”\n“Contain the attack. Keep the enemy out of the country or confine its spread.”\n“Defend our communities. Protect not only lives, but also our way of life, with proper healthcare and non-medical measures.”\n“Fight back. Develop and deploy medical countermeasures such as tests, medicines, and vaccines.”\n\nThe United States did not have a war mindset. We were not prepared, and we did not respond with the urgency of fighting a war against a novel microbial threat. We had the knowledge—what we should do, but lacked how we should do it. And we lacked the national leadership in 2020 to ensure we tackle the four challenges.\nWhy? There are three main cultures in governance:\n\n“culture of programs and process” (budget appropriation and administration).\n“culture of research and investigation” (knowledge discovery).\n“culture of operations” (knowledge deployment: implementing in the field at speed and at scale).\n\n“The challenge in the Covid war, as in any great emergency, is to meld all these cultures in practice.”\n“The Covid war revealed a collective national incompetence in governance. The leaders of the United States could not apply their country’s vast assets effectively enough in practice. Trust and confidence in government—already low—further eroded. The most successful national program to wage the war to produce and distribute vaccines, Operation Warp Speed, ended up having to be run substantially by the Department of Defense.”\nMy take: In general, I agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Two (Chapter 3: The Defenders)\n\n\n\nThe United States met te 21st century pandemic with structures mainly built for 19th century problems.\n\n\nYes, this is absolutely true. Through international travel, the world is more connected now than ever. An novel infection in one part of the world can quickly spread to several continents. And, it’s well documented the health departments have been underinvested for decades and lack infrastructure for 21st century threats, this includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe United States needs a new “National Health Security Enterprise” that provides “strategic-level governance” over, at least, the following:\n\nthe public health community (CDC and the thousands of health departments);\nthe healthcare system (public and private); and\nthe biopharma system (public and private) for developing and deploying tests, drugs, and vaccines.\n\nThe problems identified include:\n\nPublic health governance and operational capabilities are decentralized across State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial health jurisdiction. Federal health agencies have limited influence.\nThe healthcare system is not a system; it is a fragmented connection of entities (payors, plans, providers, pharma, suppliers, etc.), many in transactional relationships to profit from sickness care. Healthcare has limited preparedness connections with public health except for small CDC grants.\nThe biopharma industry has little, if any, financial incentive to invest in infectious disease emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe new “National Health Security Enterprise” would reimagine and reorganize these relationships and invest in preparedness as if we are preparing for a war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Three (in Chapter 6, p. 156: Communities Improvise with Few Tools)\n\n\n\nPartisan divisions over America’s Covid response were partly the result of policy failure, not its cause.\n\n\n“To be clear: there is a common view that politics, a ‘Red response’ and a ‘Blue response’, were the main obstacle to protecting citizens, not competence and policy failures. We found, instead, that it was more the other way around. Incompetence and policy failures, including the failure of federal executive leadership, produced bad outcomes, flying blind, and resorting to blunt instruments. Those failures and tensions fed toxic politics that further divided the country in a crisis rather than bringing it together.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Four (Chapter 2, pp. 27–28: Origins, Prevention, and Warning)\n\n\n\nThere is not enough evidence available from inside of China to come down hard on any theory of the origins of SARS-CaV-2. But what is already know drives two great agendas for the future.\n\n\nThis was one of my favorite chapters. It was very thoughtful and systematic.\nHow was SARS-CoV-2 introduced into the human population?\n\n“… humans transported wild animals carrying the virus to Wuhan.”\n“… humans transported their collected virus samples back to a lab in Wuhan and that the virus crossed over to humans in some part of the research process, from collection to experimentation.”\n“The research process theory has two main hypotheses.”\n\n“… a natural virus could have infected a human while collecting field samples in southern China, and this person traveled back to Wuhan before infecting others.”\n“… laboratory staff used modern genetic engineering tools capable of making a bat coronavirus more transmissible among humans and such experiments may have led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2.”\n\nIf SARS-CoV-2 was in a research laboratory, how did it get into the human population?\n\nintentional release\nlaboratorian infected (from cell culture or animal)\nfailure of laboratory infection control safeguards\n\n\nBottom line: there is insufficient evidence to conclude with confidence which of these theories is the likely causal explanation.\nHow can we improve for the future?\n“First, we believe governments must improve their intelligence about what is going on—their situation awareness. The past system relied on national governments like China to provide timely reporting of what was happening. That system decisively failed. We need to envision an alternative.”\n“Second, we suggest a large, difficult multinational effort to regulate the most risky research. That includes biosafety, biosecurity, and dual use research of concern.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Five (Chapters 4 and 5: Containment Fails; Mobilization Lags & Federal Crisis Management Collapses; Operation Warp Speed Begins)\n\n\n\nContainment failed and federal crisis management collapsed under President Trump’s leadership. But Trump was a comorbidity.3 Systemic problems existed before 2020, and continue to this day.\n\n\nChapter 4 chronicles the early months of 2020. “[T]he month of January 2020 was a month of warnings and early reactions. February was a month in which some nations mobilized and the United States did not.” The chapter summarized three key issues (p. 113):\n\n“the problems of overall policy design”\n“the misjudgment about silent spread combined with weakness of biomedical surveillance”\n“the limited availability of tests”\n\nPolicy design: The United States clearly underestimated, at multiple levels, its readiness to respond to a pandemic of a respiratory pathogen other than influenza. President Obama left President Trump a “todo” list of what should be done, but no road map of how to do it.4 Previous microbial threats did not adequately test our response systems. We did not realize that responsing to a pandemic, like Covid, would be more like a fighting a war, requiring a whole-of-goverment response and a whole-of-society mobilization—like a fighting a war.\nSilent spread: The United States did not prepare for an airborne transmissible respiratory pathogen with a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. The mental model was influenza or SARS-1.\nBiomedical surveillance: pending\nTesting: pending\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Six (Chapter 7: The Healthcare System Frays)\n\n\n\nAmerica’s uniquely fragmented healthcare system is unable to adequately respond in a national emergency. A new national health security enterprise is urgently needed.\n\n\n“American healthcare economics disincentivize investment in preparedness.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Seven (Chapter 9: Fighting Back with Drugs and Vaccines)\n\n\n\nHealth security is part of national security. Investments in health security, including therapeutics and vaccines, should be judged and organized on a national security standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Eight (Chapter 10: Strategy for a Global War)\n\n\n\nThe “America First” approach to vaccines backfired. Better global cooperation would have paid dividends for the United States and the world.\n\n\nThis chapter covers the global collaboration, financing, manufacturing, and distribution of Covid vaccines (Figure 1). In spite of some good intentions, vaccine equity efforts failed. The bottom line is that in a pandemic, US leadership in global vaccine equity and distribution would have ultimately benefited the US at home and abroad.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: (p. 263): This diagram shows the sectors involved in global collaboration on the development and distribution of therapeutics and vaccines. Governments at all levels, non-governmental organizations, philanthropies, and the private biopharmaceutical industry all have important roles to play. During the Covid pandemic, emergency organizations like the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator were created to try to help coordinate these different sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Nine (Chapter 8: Trust and Confidence Break Down)\n\n\n\nCommunication in a crisis is a vital policy choice. In both the Trump and Biden administrations, poor communication aggravated the breakdown of public trust and confidence, and undermined efforts to combat misinformaion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Ten (Chapter 11: America the Competent?)\n\n\n\nWe must do better next time. Because there will be a next time."

    "text": "Decision making\n\nCausal and probabilistic reasoning\nDecision making is our most important daily activity. Decisions drive vision, strategy, execution, problem solving, performance, evaluation, and continuous improvement. Decisions can be rapid and guided by experience and intuition, or they can be the product of a slow, deliberative process, usually by teams. So, what is a decision?\n“A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources” [1]. Every decision has causal assumptions, predictions, and opportunity costs. For example, we might choose option \\(A\\) over option \\(B\\) because we predict option \\(A\\) will achieve outcome \\(Y\\) with higher probability \\(P\\) (often unstated). The opportunity cost is the lost benefit of the better option not chosen or not considered. Implicit (non-conscious) cognitive biases, individually and collectively, can drive the strength of our causal beliefs, predictions, and decisions. Therefore, to improve team decision making, we also need to strengthen our capabilities in causal and probabilistic reasoning, balancing trade-offs from competing objectives, and leading team deliberations in the face of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (so-called VUCA).\nWhat public health officials bring to the decision-making table are the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics that support causal and probabilistic reasoning, respectfully. Causal reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the key drivers? (root causes); Why and how is this happening? (root causes); Asking “why?” 5 times. (“The 5 Whys”); Does this countermeasure work? (efficacy); Will it work in the real world? (effectiveness); and Which intervention is more cost-effective? (efficiency).\nProbabilistic reasoning appears in questions such as: What are the chances that this exposure leads to infection? (prediction); What are the chances this countermeasure will work? (prediction); What are the sensitivity and specificity of this test or classification? (proportion of false-negative and/or false-positive of any test result or conjecture). This type of reasoning,\n\\[\n\\Pr (\\text{effect} \\mid \\text{cause})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{evidence} \\mid \\text{hypothesis})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{test results} \\mid \\text{presence of disease})\n\\] is called causal reasoning (or predictive reasoning).1\nIn contrast, What are the chances my hypothesis (conjecture, suspected diagnosis) is correct given the evidence? What is the chance of being infected given a test result? This type of reasoning,\n\\[\n\\Pr (\\text{cause} \\mid \\text{effect})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{hypothesis} \\mid \\text{evidence})\n\\] \\[\n\\Pr (\\text{presence of disease} \\mid \\text{test results})\n\\]\nis called evidential reasoning (or diagnostic reasoning) and is the inverse conditional probability of causal reasoning. Unfortunately, human beings are very poor at evidential reasoning because it requires Bayes theorem to calculate probabilities. Humans are unaware of this cognitive limitation; hence, we are overconfident in our assessments and, with confirmation bias, may develop certainty and rigid beliefs. For these reasons, we must approach VUCA with genuine intellectual humility and embrace curiosity over certainty. In fact, in the face of VUCA, key decisions are better managed like hypotheses to be tested.\nEvery decision involves intuition, emotions, and cognitive and social psychology. Because of VUCA, decision making is often more art than science, and the “art” depends on psychological safety and effective interpersonal skills for managing conflict and building consensus. Decisions in organizational environments evolve within a historical, political, and cultural context that may constrain or support good decision making.\nThe failure to understand basic causal and evidential reasoning leads to wrong inferences, rigid beliefs, and poor decisions. We have seen this time and time again in the SARS’CoV-2 pandemic. The only practical and effective approach is to embrace humility, curiosity, and learning."

    "text": "Decision intelligence\nFor public health officials, decision intelligence is the practical integration of problem solving, decision quality, performance improvement, and behavioral, data, and information sciences.2\n\nProblem solving\nMany public health officials use components of decision intelligence but are unaware of its integrated structure. Figure 2 graphically depicts the problem-solving structure as a causal graph (also called directed acyclic graph or DAG).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Causal graph to guide problem solving\n\n\nThe easiest example to understand is clinical diagnosis and treatment. When a patient presents to an emergency room with chest pain (problem), the clinician considers and prioritizes consequences (death, discomfort, etc.) and causes (myocardial infarction, esophageal reflux, anxiety, etc.), tests hypotheses by collecting data (history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests), and then uses the results to select and implement a treatment plan (countermeasures). The patient’s response to treatment is more data for learning, and for adjusting hypotheses and treatments. This whole process is a series of problem solving decisions, learning, and continuous improvement. The seasoned clinical is an expert in clinician decision intelligence.\n\n\nDecision quality\nSimilarly, complex problem-solving is a series of important, causally-linked decisions to (a) select and focus on the right problem, consequences, and root causes, and (b) design, evaluate, and improve countermeasures (prevention, control, mitigation) to achieve the primary objectives while minimizing harmful outcomes and unintended consequences.\nDecision quality is understanding and improving the requirements of making good decisions (Figure 3) even when the decisions are intuitive, fast, or informal.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Decision quality (DQ) has six requirements. A good decision is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n\nAt a minimum, a decision quality checklist (Table 1) improves the quality of decisions at any stage of problem solving. A good decision is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n\nTable 1: Checklist: key questions to answer for decision quality (DQ)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nRequirement\nKey question to ask\n\n\n\n\n1\nFrame\nAre we clear on the problem we are solving?\n\n\n2\nValues\nHave we identified what we truly want?\n\n\n3\nAlternatives\nDo we have a good set of alternatives?\n\n\n4\nInformation\nHave we gathered the relevant information?\n\n\n5\nReasoning\nHow will we evaluate alternatives to find the one that gets us the most of what what we truly want?\n\n\n6\nCommitment\nAre we committed to follow through on our choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Decision quality requirements and work flow\n\n\nBased on Figure 4, Table 2 summarizes specific areas of professional and systems developement to improve decision quality.\n\n\nTable 2: Decision quality requirements engages multiple disciplines and skillsets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nRequirement\nPriority areas for development, training, and improvement\n\n\n\n\n1\nFrame\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) decision competency in PDSA problem solving\n\n\n2\nInformation\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) data, information systems, and data science\n\n\n3\nAlternatives\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) knowledge management (discovery, translation, and integration)\n\n\n4\nReasoning\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) causal and probabilistic reasoning, deliberation, and decision science\n\n\n5\nCommitment\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) Engage and involve stakeholders to increase commitment to action\n\n\n6\nValues\n\\(\\leftarrow\\) Understand the consequences, trade-offs, and opportunity costs\n\n\n\n\nTeam problem solving is a series of deliberative decision processes that are divergent (generating creative ideas and options) and convergent (selecting or prioritizing options for action). First, selecting the right problem to tackle is a decision problem, and it is the most important. Second, a root cause analysis identifies what causes the problem. Third, selecting countermeasures for root causes, problem, and consequences is, again, a decision problem. The key point is that problem-solving is a series of linked, interdependent decisions, each with quality requirements. The quality of a decision can only be as strong as its weakest link, and the quality of problem solving can only be as strong as the quality of those decisions.\n\n\nPerformance improvement\nPut together, decision intelligence is the integration of problem solving and decision quality within a performance improvement framework, ensuring quality and continuous improvement in decision making. Table 3 summarizes decision intelligence as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) problem solving.\n\n\nTable 3: Decision intelligence is the integration of problem solving and decision quality within a performance improvement framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDSA\nComponents of Problem Solving\nKey decision questions\n\n\n\n\nPlan\nProblem finding and definition\nWhat is main problem to solve?\n\n\n\nConsequence (risk) analysis\nWhat are the consequences?\n\n\n\nRoot cause (diagnostic) analysis\nWhat causes the problem?\n\n\n\nCountermeasure design and testing\nWhat strategies and actions work?\n\n\nDo\nCountermeasure implementation\nHow do we deploy countermeasures?\n\n\nStudy\nCountermeasure (causal) evaluation\nHow do we measure and test effectiveness?\n\n\nAct\nAct on what you learn to improve\nHow do we learn and improve?\n\n\n\n\nWe can now appreciate that PDSA problem-solving is a series of decisions (Figure 5): finding and selecting the most important problems to tackle; identifying and prioritizing the consequences caused by the unresolved problem(s); identifying (or discovering) and prioritizing the root causes of the problem(s); selecting effective countermeasures for each level (problem, root causes, and consequences); and deploying and evaluating the effectiveness of the countermeasures where evaluation is a type of causal analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: PDSA problem solving is a series of decisions\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral, data, and information sciences\nDecision intelligence starts with mastering the concepts above which can improve everyday important decisions. Without this foundation it is not possible to optimally use data and information. We often jump to building flashy data dashboards for making “data-driven” decisions without checking if we are solving the right problem or if we have good decision processes to begin with.\nFinally, decisions involve people and actions. So we must understand basic behavioral sciences, especially behavioral economics.\nI will cover these topics in future blog updates."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis is part of the series The CDPH Way—Becoming the best at getting better.\nFor background, here is an overview slide set and lean reporting templates.\nAt the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) we are on journey of lean transformation. Lean thinking and practice is “systematically developing people to solve problems and consuming the fewest possible resources while continuously improving processes to provide value to community members and prosperity to society”1 The value pillars of lean are “respect for people” and “continuous improvement.” These two pillars, along with four additional components, make up the lean operating sytem at the CDPH:\nTo be a lean organization, these six components are required, and if one is missing, organizational effectiveness and mission will suffer. Every health organization should strive to be a lean organization, and it starts with “respect for people.”\nHowever, what does it mean to respect people? What does it mean to give respect and to feel respected?2\nTo be respectful, first we must understand the concept of “universal values.” Universal values are values that apply to everyone, everywhere and leaves no one behind, including our adversaries. I learned the concept of universal values from Dr. Monica Sharma, former director of leadership development at the United Nations, and author of Radical Transformational Leadership: Strategic Action for Change Agents [1].\nIn tackling complex public health problems around the world, Dr. Sharma discovered that universal values enabled stakeholders to transcend differences, find common ground, and solve problems together. The universal values she discovered to be the most effective and robust are dignity, equity, and compassion. To this short list I added humility. With authenticity and integrity, we should strive to embody and promote universal values in every interaction and in every conversation.\nThe first universal value is humility. To be humble is to believe genuinely that you are not better or more important than any person you are engaging with regardless of their social or occupational status, wealth, or ability.\nThe second universal value is compassion. To understand compassion, we must distinguish it from sympathy and empathy. With sympathy I care about your suffering. With empathy I feel your suffering. With compassion I want to relieve your suffering. Be aware and mindful: because of our implicit (nonconscious) biases we are more likely to empathize with people “like us” (eg, tribalism). Instead, we endeavor to have empathy for those unlike us, and to have compassion towards those who are vulnerable or suffering even if we do not share values.\nThe third universal value is equity; that is, to treat everyone with fairness regardless of their social or occupational status, wealth, or ability. Fairness does not mean everyone is treated equally, but rather we are responsive to their needs. When we are humble, compassionate, and fair with others, especially when we differ by social or occupational status, wealth, or ability, then they will feel dignity — “the quality or state of being worthy, honored, or esteemed.”3\nThe fourth universal value is dignity. When we engage others, and we embody and promote the universal values of humility, compassion, and equity (fairness), then they are more likely to experience dignity—and to feel respected. Dignity is also “the right of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically.”4\nThe universal values of humility, compassion, equity (fairness), and dignity apply to everyone, everywhere, including your adversaries. Universal values apply where you live, learn, work, play, and pray.\nI started with humility because it is a very deep and powerful concept. There are different types of humility we should cultivate.\nGeneral humility “is the noble choice to forgo your status, deploy your resources or use your influence for the good of others before yourself” [2].\nIntellectual humility is a mindset5 that involves recognizing and owning our intellectual limitations in service of pursuing deeper knowledge, truth, and understanding [3].\nCultural humility is committing to lifelong learning and critical self-reflection; realizing our power, privilege, and biases; redressing power imbalances for respectful partnerships; and for promoting institutional accountability (learn more).\nDiscovering and cultivating your ability to be humble will supercharge your learning, your relationships, and your effectiveness."

    "text": "ChatGPT query\nTo get a consensus view on respect for people in the lean health care context, I queried ChatGPT which provided a very reasonable answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT on 2023-03-23\n\n\n\nFor lean in the health care context, what is the best way to show respect for people?\n“Showing respect for people is a fundamental value in lean quality improvement, and it can be demonstrated in various ways. Here are some best ways to show respect for people:\n\nListen actively: Listening actively is an important part of showing respect for people. When someone is speaking, pay attention, show interest, and ask questions to clarify and better understand their perspective.\nValue diversity: Value the diversity of people’s backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Recognize that everyone brings unique knowledge and skills to the table.\nEncourage participation: Encourage everyone to participate and share their ideas. Create a safe and supportive environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves.\nProvide training and development: Providing training and development opportunities shows that you value people’s knowledge, skills, and expertise. It also helps people grow and develop professionally.\nRecognize and appreciate contributions: Recognize and appreciate people’s contributions and successes. Celebrate achievements and milestones, and show gratitude for their hard work and dedication.\nProvide a healthy work environment: Provide a healthy work environment that promotes well-being and work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside of work and respect their personal time.\n\nBy showing respect for people, organizations can create a culture of trust, collaboration, and continuous improvement. This can lead to better outcomes for patients, increased employee satisfaction, and improved overall performance.”"

Striving to embody and promote the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion and humility, I work to mobilize communities and institutions to transform policies and systems towards a culture of equity, antiracism, healing and health for all people and our planet. As State Public Health Officer, I exercise leadership and legal authority to protect and promote equity and health. As CDPH Director, I direct a nationally accredited state public health department. I am volunteer adjunct faculty at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. My curriculum vitae is here.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tomás J. Aragón, MD, DrPH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

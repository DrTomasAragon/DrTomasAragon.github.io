    "text": "Multiple dispatch example in Julia\nI was the founding developer of the R ‘epitools’ package.6 I developed functions for basic epidemiologic analyses (eg, 2x2 tables), several from Rothman’s “Modern Epidemiology” textbook. For example, if I wanted to create a function to calculate an odds ratio for a 2x2 contingency table, the data could be provided in several ways:\n\nfour integer counts,\ntwo proportions, or\na 2x2 table (matrix)\ntwo vectors with categorical data\n\nIf I wanted to write one function to handle these possible data types as arguments, I would have to do a lot of processing and checking of data types in order to call the next function (nested or external). This requires much more work than is necessary. Let’s do this is Julia using multiple dispatch.\nIn 2003, we published a study that provided evidence that drinking unfiltered municipal tap water was associated with developing cryptosporidiosis among patients with advanced HIV disease [2]. Here is a contingency table from this paper.\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\n12\n6\n\n\nIntermediate\n35\n64\n\n\nLowest\n2\n29\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate the unadjusted odds ratio comparing the highest exposure category to the lowest exposure category. Here is the 2x2 table for this calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\n12\n6\n\n\nLowest\n2\n29\n\n\n\nFor an appropriately structured table, for example,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure\nCase\nControl\n\n\n\n\nHighest\na\nb\n\n\nLowest\nc\nd\n\n\n\nthe odds ratio is the cross-product:\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a d}{b c}\n\\]\nFor a case-control design, the odds ratio is the ratio of the exposure odds.\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{p_1/(1 - p_1)}{p_0/(1 - p_0)}\n\\]\nWe will create three functions that can receive three different types of arguments to calculate an odds ratio.\n\nfour integer counts,\ntwo proportions, or\na 2x2 table (matrix)\n\nThe catch is that the three functions will have the same name: oddsratio. This is possible in Julia because of multiple dispatch. In contrast, R is single dispatch.\n\n## Function 1\nfunction oddsratio(a::Int, b::Int, c::Int, d::Int)\n    or = (a * d) / (b * c)\n    return or\nend\n\noddsratio (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nLet’s test the oddsratio function by passing four integers from our 2x2 table.\n\noddsratio(12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n29.0\n\n\nHere is the second function to handle arguments that are proportions; for example, the exposure odds comparing cases to controls.\n\n## Function 2\nfunction oddsratio(p1::Float64, p0::Float64)\n    or = ((p1)/(1 - p1)) / ((p0)/(1 - p0))\n    return or\nend\n\noddsratio (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nLet’s test the oddsratio function by passing two proportions from our 2x2 table.\n\nprop1 = 12 / (12 + 2) # probability of exposure among cases\nprop0 = 6 / (6 + 29) # probability of exposure among controls\noddsratio(prop1, prop0)\n\n28.999999999999982\n\n\nFinally, here is the third function to handle an argument that is a 2x2 table (matrix).\n\n## Function 3\nfunction oddsratio(x::Matrix{Int})\n    or = (x[1, 1] * x[2, 2]) / (x[1, 2] * x[2, 1])\n    return or\nend\n\noddsratio (generic function with 3 methods)\n\n\nLet’s test the oddsratio function by passing our 2x2 table.\n\ntab = [12 6; 2 29]\n\n2×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 12   6\n  2  29\n\n\n\noddsratio(tab)\n\n29.0\n\n\nThis is called multiple dispatch. The oddsratio function has three methods and can handle multiple data types. Notice how easy that was.\n\nmethods(oddsratio)\n\n# 3 methods for generic function oddsratio from Main.Notebook:\n\n- oddsratio(x::Matrix{Int64}) in Main.Notebook at /Users/tja/myblog/posts/2023-01-14-my-journey-from-r-to-julia/index.qmd:236\n- oddsratio(p1::Float64, p0::Float64) in Main.Notebook at /Users/tja/myblog/posts/2023-01-14-my-journey-from-r-to-julia/index.qmd:207\n- oddsratio(a::Int64, b::Int64, c::Int64, d::Int64) in Main.Notebook at /Users/tja/myblog/posts/2023-01-14-my-journey-from-r-to-julia/index.qmd:180\nWow! Now anyone, including me, can add new methods to the oddsratio function without disrupting previous methods. This is very powerful. Other languages accomplish this using object-oriented programming. Julia is not an object-oriented programming lanuage."

    "text": "2 Book highlights\n\n2.1 Chapter 1 Introduction\nMy blog posting “My Journey from R to Julia” is a good summary of what is covered in the Introduction. I will cover just one item—execution speed, and compare it to R.\nWe will construct a for loop summation of a random sequence of integers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) that are sampled without replacment.1 Here is the correct answer as a reference:\n\n## In Julia\njulia&gt;  sum(1:1_000_000_000)\n500000000500000000\n\n## In R\n&gt; options(digits=20)\n&gt; sum(1:1000000000)\n[1] 5.000000005e+17\n\nBy default, R would give the wrong answer (not shown) because it uses 64-bit floating point numbers.2 To get the correct answer we need 64-bit integers. For this I used the bit64 R package to get the correct answer (below).\n\n\n&gt; require(\"bit64\")\n&gt; n = 1000000000\n&gt; samp = sample(1:n, n, replace=FALSE)\n&gt; sum_n = function(x){\n+     s = as.integer64(0)\n+     for (i in x){\n+         s = s + i\n+     }\n+     s\n+ }\n&gt; system.time(x &lt;- sum_n(samp))\n     user    system   elapsed \n11094.792   101.378 11201.145 \n&gt; x\ninteger64\n[1] 500000000500000000\n\nTo get the correct answer in R, the execution time was about 11,095 seconds. Okay, let’s try Julia.\n\n\njulia&gt; using StatsBase, BenchmarkTools\njulia&gt; n = 1_000_000_000;\njulia&gt; samp = sample(1:n, n, replace=false);\njulia&gt; function sum_n(x)\n           s = 0\n               for i in x\n                   s = s + i\n               end\n               return s\n       end\nsum_n (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia&gt; @btime sum_n(samp)\n  158.118 ms (1 allocation: 16 bytes)\n500000000500000000\n\nIn Julia, it took about 158 milliseconds. R is about 70,168 times slower than Julia!3\nConclusion: Compared to R, Julia can handle large for loops for summation and give an accurate answer fast. To add integers correctly using a for loop, R requires using the bit64 package but is 70,168 time slower than Julia. With R, we are taught to avoid for loops — now you know why. However, a for loop is a workhorse tool that we want available to us; hence, this a huge advantage of Julia.\nTo see more benchmarks visit Which programming language is fastest?.\n\n\n2.2 2 Getting started with Julia\n\n2.2.1 Basic data types\nIf you are familar with R or Python, you will feel comfortable with Julia. Here is a character:\n\n## character; notice single quotation marks\n'a'\n\n'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)\n\n\nA string is a collection of characters:\n\n## string; notice double quotation marks\n\"Hello World\"\n\n\"Hello World\"\n\n\nAn array is a collection in brackets. A vector is a 1-dimensional array. Commas are used to create a vector. By default, the vector is displayed vertically, but it is not a “column vector”.\n\n## vector\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nTo display horizontally use the show function.4\n\n## vector\nshow([1, 2, 3])\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nA matrix is a two-dimensional array. Numbers separated by spaces create one row of a matrix. This is not a vector.\n\n## matrix\n[1 2 3 4]\n\n1×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3  4\n\n\nMatrix rows separated by a semi-colon creates a multi-row matrix:\n\n## matrix\n[1 2 3 4; 6 7 8 9]\n\n2×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3  4\n 6  7  8  9\n\n\nThe size function returns the dimensions of an array. Previously, we learned that a vector is a 1-dimensional array.\n\nsize([1, 2, 3])\n\n(3,)\n\n\nWe see this vector is 1-dimensional ((3,)); in contrast,\n\nsize([1 2 3])\n\n(1, 3)\n\n\nthis is a (1, 3) matrix or 2-dimensional.\nA tuple is a collection in parentheses, and commas separate the elements.

Immutable objects increase computational speed.\n\n## tuple\n(1, 2, 3)\n\n(1, 2, 3)\n\n\nTuple elements can be named.\n\n## named tuple\n(four = 4, five = 5, six = 6)\n\n(four = 4, five = 5, six = 6)\n\n\nThe assigment operation (=) is used to bind data values to a variable.

Keyword arguments are separated from the positional arguments by a semicolon (;). Any argument, positional or keyword, can be assigned a default value. We’ll create oddsratio2function to calculate a confidence interval using the Normal approximation. The keyword argument will have a default confidence level of 0.95.\n\nusing Distributions # to access standard normal distribution \nfunction oddsratio2(a, b, c, d; level = 0.95)\n    zv = quantile(Normal(), 0.5*(1 + level))\n    est = (a * d) / (b * c)\n    log_or = log(est)\n    se_log_or = sqrt((1/a) + (1/b) + (1/c) + (1/d))\n    lcl = exp(log_or - zv * se_log_or)\n    ucl = exp(log_or + zv * se_log_or)\n    return (\n        or = est, \n        confint = (lcl, ucl), \n        level = level\n    )\nend\n\noddsratio2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBy default, oddsratio2 will calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\noddsratio2(12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n(or = 29.0, confint = (5.110695577009899, 164.55685675804662), level = 0.95)\n\n\nI can also calculate 99% confidence intervals:\n\nresults = oddsratio2(12, 6, 2, 29; level = 0.99)\n\n(or = 29.0, confint = (2.9619778898301936, 283.93189661797715), level = 0.99)\n\n\nAnd we can index elements of the named tuple.\n\nresults.confint\n\n(2.9619778898301936, 283.93189661797715)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Anonymous functions\nFunctions can be arguments to functions. For example, we will create a times_two function and past it to other functions.\n\ntimes_two(x) = 2 * x\nmap(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  2\n  4\n 16\n\n\n\nsum(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n22\n\n\n\nusing StatsBase\nmean(times_two, [1, 2, 8])\n\n7.333333333333333\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass the times_two function as an anonymous function; that is, a function without a name.\n\nmap(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n  2\n  4\n 16\n\n\n\nsum(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n22\n\n\n\nmean(x -&gt; 2 * x, [1, 2, 8])\n\n7.333333333333333\n\n\nWe can even calculate the odds ratio as an anonymous function.\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), (12, 6, 2, 29)...)\n\n29.0\n\n\nNotice I used a trick. By default, the map function maps and executes a function with elements of a collection (eg, [1 ,2, 8]). However, for the odds ratio calcuation, I need to map the arguments (a, b, c, d) to their values (12, 6, 2, 29), then calculate the odds ratio. Therefore, I used the splat operator (...) to break up the collection of values so that they could be mapped to their arguments first. Although I used a tuple (12, 6, 2, 29), an array also works [12, 6, 2, 29].\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), [12, 6, 2, 29]...)\n\n29.0\n\n\nThe splat operator (...) converts [12, 6, 2, 29] to 12, 6, 2, 29 which is very convenient if the vector is very large. In this case, with only four integers, I could have passed the integers without the splat operator.\n\nmap((a, b, c, d) -&gt; (a * d)/(b * c), 12, 6, 2, 29)\n\n29.0\n\n\nChapter 1 also covers other topics including loops, conditional expressions, and scoping. Chapters 3 to 7 cover practical tools for processing and managing data in Julia. I will focus the remainder of this book review on data frames.\n\n\n\n2.3 Chapters 8–13: Working with data frames\nThe author is a lead developer of the DataFrames.jl Julia package. So in these chapters he covers this package thoroughly and you will not be disappointed. I will over cover the following:\n\nDownloading a CSV data file from a website\nReading a CSV file into a data frame\nConducting a common analytic workflows\n\nThe data set we will use is from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS).

    "text": "Alum of the Year\nI was very honored and humbled to be selected the 2021 Alumnus of the Year. Below are my comments delivered at the commencement and thanks to the SPH community.\n\nCommencement comments (starts at 58:57)\n\n\nI want to express my enormous gratitude to the UC Berkeley SPH community for selecting me as the “2021 Alumnus of the Year.” For me, this is a tremendous honor. The SPH has a very special place in my heart\nI graduated in 2000 with a Doctor of Public Health degree. From 2003 to 2010, at the SPH I directed a CDC center on infectious disease emergency preparedness and response. Of course, the Feds cut all our funding, so in 2011, I became the Health Officer of San Francisco.\nOn January 9, 2020, the WHO announced a mysterious coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China. On January 21st, I activated our public health emergency response, and the same day the CDC confirmed the first coronavirus case in the US. On Sunday, March 15th, I woke up not realizing that the very next day, March 16th, I, along with six Bay Area health officers, would be issuing the first regional stay-at-home orders in the United States. California followed on March 19th, and New York City on March 22nd.\nThat decision, came together with lightning speed because we had developed a relationship based on trust, respect, and universal values. Dr. Monica Sharma, former director of leadership development at the United Nations, defines universal values as values that apply to every person on earth, leaving no one behind. She learned that embodying and promoting the values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility were the most effective: they enabled people to come together, transcend differences, find common ground, and solve complex problems—in our case—could we dodge a public health catastrophe through swift public health action?\nOur team had embraced what Dr. Sharma calls radical transformational leadership—leading change from the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility to transform self, people, systems and cultures towards equity, antiracism, and sustainable results.\nEmbodying humility opens your heart and mind to listening deeply to opposing points of view; it accelerates group learning and problem solving. With humility you come to appreciate and value multiple truths. You embrace curiosity over certainty, inquiry before advocacy, and discernment over judgment.\nToday, as you embark on your public health careers, I hope you will become radical transformational leaders, and embody and promote the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion, and humility in every interaction, in every conversation, and in every decision.\nThank you!"

    "text": "Letter of gratitude to SPH community\nMarch 28, 2021\nDear UC Berkeley SPH family,\nI want to express my enormous gratitude for selecting me as the 2021 Alum of the Year. For me, this is a tremendous honor. UC Berkeley SPH has a very special place in my heart. I grew up in San Francisco’s Mission District. My family immigrated from Nicaragua in the 1950s. My father completed high school and my mother completed sixth grade. He worked as a cook and dishwasher and she as a seamstress. When I was 5 my mom became a single parent raising four children. She became my role model and moral compass.\nI was accepted to UC Berkeley at the age of 17 through the Affirmative Action and Education Opportunity Programs. Unfortunately, I dropped out after two quarters because I was struggling academically. I did not have the academic preparation of other students. I enrolled in SF State, improved my study skills, got my grades up and returned to UC Berkeley in 1981 to study molecular biology. As an undergraduate I enrolled in a SPH course on cancer epidemiology. I was hooked! I knew that public health and epidemiology would always be a part of my career.\nIn medical school, I received my MPH degree. After my primary care internal medicine residency and infectious disease fellowship at UCSF, I received my Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) from the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I had the privilege to learn from the best epidemiology and biostatistics professors in the nation. I studied everything from advanced biostatistics to mathematical demography and modeling.\nSince 2003 I have been a voluntary lecturer at the UCB SPH teaching “Applied Epidemiology Using R,” even after I became health officer of San Francisco in 2011. When I started teaching this course few were interested in R. I had the privilege to see firsthand computational thinking and data science explode in innovation. Through their innovative class projects, my students were teaching me more than I was teaching them. I experienced what I call “population health data science” (descriptive, predictive, causal inference, modeling, and optimization methods). I get to bring all of this innovation into my public health practice!\nAs public health officials we make daily decisions in the face of uncertainty, time constraints, competing objectives, and limited information. This culminated with the Bay Area health officers issuing shelter-in-place orders on March 16, 2020. All of my public health decisions and public health orders have been influenced by the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.\nI am indebted to you all—students, professors, and staff! You have had a real hand in my public health career and actions.\nThat is why being selected the 2021 University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health Alum of the Year is the most valued honor I could ever receive.\nThank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nWith tremendous gratitude,\nTomás Aragón\nUC Berkeley Class of 1983 (AB, Molecular Biology)\nUC Berkeley School of Public Health, Class of 2000 (DrPH, Epidemiology)"

Automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence—the Smart Machine Age (SMA)—are disrupting and displacing the workforce. Transdisciplinary teamwork is the new norm. People skills, creative and critical thinking, innovation, and improvement are more important now than ever!\nUnfortunately, our native cognitive abilities have not evolved at the same pace [2]. Our brain is wired to sense “dangers” and react based on perceived threats and emotions. Our brain is wired for efficiency: it defaults to personality traits, fast decisions via nonconscious schemas or learned mindsets. We resist new ideas that demand new cognitive effort. Our decisions are suboptimal due to cognitive biases: (a) protection of mindset, (b) personality and habits, (c) faulty reasoning, (d) automatic associations, (e) relative thinking, and (f) social influences [3].\nHumans are prone to defensiveness from our innate drive to protect our ego2 and to avoid our fears (vulnerability, uncertainty, risk, intellectual or emotional exposure, uninvited scrutiny). Science shows these behaviors impede creativity, critical and innovative thinking, reflective listening, and emotionally engaging others [1]. We mitigate these biases using brain science. We start with a new definition of “being smart” (“NewSmart”). We must embrace intellectual humility, honesty, and courage and redesign organizations for this new age. Professor Edward Hess’ NewSmart Humility has four interdependent components:\n\nNewSmart principles,\nHumility mindset,\nNewSmart behaviors, and\nNewSmart organization [1]."

NewSmart is a measure not of what you know or how much you know but of\n\nthe quality of your thinking, listening, collaborating, and learning;\nhow good you are at “not” knowing and decoupling your beliefs (not values) from your ego;\nhow good you are at being open to continually stress-testing your beliefs about how the world works;\nhow good you are at trying out new ideas and ways to accomplish your objectives and learning from those experiments” [1].\n\n“So what does the high-quality thinking, learning, and emotional engagement underlying NewSmart look like in practice?” The NewSmart principles are worth committing to memory:\n\n“I’m defined not by what I know or how much I know, but by the quality of my thinking, listening, relating, and collaborating.”\n“My mental models are not reality—they are only my generalized stories of how my world works.”\n“I’m not my ideas, and I must decouple my beliefs (not values) from my ego.”\n“I must be open-minded and treat my beliefs (not values) as hypotheses to be constantly tested and subject to modification by better data.”\n“My mistakes and failures are opportunities to learn.”\n\nThis Table compares the “old smart” to the NewSmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld smart\nNewSmart\n\n\n\n\nI know\nI’m good at not knowing\n\n\nI tell\nI ask\n\n\nDefend my views\nImprove my views\n\n\nSeek confirmation\nSeek truth\n\n\nClose mind\nOpen mind\n\n\nInsecure if beliefs are challenged\nInsecure if beliefs are NOT challenged\n\n\nMistakes are bad\nMistakes are learning opportunities\n\n\nPerfectionism\nLearning"

    "section": "The NewSmart behaviors",
    "text": "The NewSmart behaviors\nThe NewSmart and Humility mindsets drive behaviors that are supported and improved with evidence-based skills. Hess clusters them into four behavioral categories:\n\nQuieting Ego,\nManaging Self (one’s thinking and emotions),\nReflective Listening, and\nOtherness (emotionally connecting and relating).\n\n\n(a) Quieting Ego\n“Quieting Ego is how we can deliberately work to reduce our reflexive emotional defensiveness; have empathy and open-mindedness; engage in Reflective Listening; and proactively seek other people’s feedback and perspectives to stress-test our own thinking. Quieting Ego is a way of practicing and operationalizing Humility. To quiet our ego is to perceive others and the world without filtering everything through a self-focused lens and to tamp down on negative or self-protective”inner talk” that is driven consciously or subconsciously by our fears and insecurities” [1]. Quieting Ego starts with four evidence-based behaviors:\n\nmindfulness,\nmindfulness meditation,\ndaily Quiet Ego reminders, and\npracticing gratitude.\n\n\n\n(b) Managing Self (one’s thinking and emotions)\n“Managing Self—our emotions and thinking—aids us in engaging in the higher-level thinking and behavior required … . It’s necessary to remain open-minded and be willing to test our beliefs and modify our points of view if presented with better data. It’s also how we’re able to overcome our fear of mistakes in order to take ownership of them and learn from them, and helps us more effectively relate to and collaborate with others” [1].\n“Managing Self comes from the science of ‘self-regulation’ and ‘self-control,’ which are broad psychological concepts that mean to monitor and manage one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors” [1] and start with these practices:\n\nslowing down,\nmanaging thoughts,\nmanaging emotions, and\nemotional intelligence.\n\nFor managing thoughts, Hess’ “thinking toolbox” starts with familiar concepts from population health lean (PDSA problem-solving, root cause analysis, etc.). We also highly recommend reading Richard Nisbett’s Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking [5].\nFor managing emotions, “We’ve discussed how ego and fear are the two big learning inhibitors and explored our reflexive tendency as humans to be emotionally defensive and self-protective. We’ve discussed how negative emotions can undermine our behavior and thinking and how positive emotions can improve them. Stress, anger, and anxiety can cause narrow-mindedness and the fight-flee-or-freeze syndrome. … Positive emotions, on the other hand, have been scientifically linked not just to higher health and well-being but also to broader attention, open-mindedness, deeper focus, and more flexible thinking, all of which underlie creativity and innovative thinking. Positive emotions also improve decision making and general cognitive processing.”\nHess’ “managing emotions toolbox” includes effective techniques such as\n\npsychological distancing,\nreframing,\npositive memories,\npositive self-talk, and\nif-then implementation plans.\n\nSee Hess book for illustrative examples [1].\nEmotional intelligence (EI) is “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. … Sensitivity to other people’s emotions has been found to be a key to effective collaboration.” The EI model includes these abilities:\n\nPerceive and differentiate emotions in self and others.\nUse emotions to facilitate reasoning, aid judgment and memory processes, problem solve, communicate with others, and facilitate open-mindedness.\nUnderstand emotions by analyzing the emotions of yourself and others.\nManage emotions in self and others.\n\n\n\n(c) Reflective Listening\n“Reflective Listening is so important because it underlies all [other skills]. Why? Because your thinking and learning are limited by cognitive biases, emotional defensiveness, ego, and fear. You need, then, to truly listen to others to open your mind, push past your biases and mental models, and mitigate self-absorption in order to collaborate and build better relationships. [We know from] evidence that it’s hard for any of us to critique our own thinking and truly think critically. We’re just too wired to confirm what we already believe, and we feel too comfortable having a cohesive simple story of how our world works. We need to have thinking ‘partners’ who force us to confront those biases, and we need to listen to them” [1].\nReflective Listening includes these practices:\n\npreparing to listen reflectively,\nlistening with a Quiet Ego and an open mind, and\ninquiring with genuine curiosity, humility, and respect (humble inquiry).\n\nHere’s a preparation checklist for Reflective Listening:\n\nIs my mind clear? If not, take several deep, slow breaths.\nAm I calm emotionally? If not, take a few more deep breaths, focusing on breathing in for four seconds and very, very slowly breathing out for four seconds.\nSay to yourself a couple of times:\n\n\n“I am not my ideas.”\n“It’s not all about me.”\n“Don’t be defensive.”\n“Ask questions before telling.”\n“Don’t interrupt.”\n“Stay focused.”\n“Critique ideas, not people.”\n“Listen to understand, not to confirm.”\n\n\n\n(d) Otherness (emotionally connecting and relating)\nHess writes “We need others because we can’t think, innovate, or relate at our best alone. To relate to other people you first have to make a connection with them. It is by building a relationship over time that you build trust, and when you have caring trust, you have set the stage for the highest level of human engagement. … So how do you get better at connecting and relating? It’s quite obvious that connecting and relating to people is inhibited by arrogance, self-absorption, self-centeredness, not listening, closed-mindedness, lack of empathy, emotional defensiveness, and the ego protection and fear that flow from the Old Smart mental model. Accepting NewSmart and Humility as well as practicing Quieting Ego, Managing Self, and Reflective Listening lays the groundwork for relationship building with others.”\nOtherness behaviors include:\n\nusing the fives keys to connecting,\nbuilding trust and conveying caring,\npreparing for meetings,\nchoosing words wisely.\n\nThe five keys to connecting are\n\nbe present,\nbe genuine,\ncommunicate affirmation,\nlisten effectively, and\ncommunicate support.\n\nPrepare for meetings with this checklist:\n\nbe really present,\ngenuinely smile—a big smile,\nmake eye contact,\nbe positive,\nlisten reflectively,\nstay fully present, and\ndo no harm.\n\nChoose your words wisely: use “Yes, and” instead of “Yes, but” to build on the ideas of others; use “I believe” instead of “I think” to acknowledge your ideas are hypotheses open to critique and testing; use “I want to” instead of “I have to” and “I won’t” instead of “I can’t” to emphasize the power of choice."

The history of the Causal Revolution will surprise, inspire, entertain, and—at times—shock you! Below is my 5-star Amazon review of the Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect (which became an Amazon “Best Seller” within the first week of its release!).\n“Wow! I am a physician epidemiologist with a doctorate in epidemiology and I teach computational epidemiology (with R) at UC Berkeley. I had the opportunity to study biostatistics from the best professors at UC Berkeley School of Public Health (Steve Selvin, Nicolas Jewell, Richard Brand, and many more). The field of causal inference was just beginning to take off with biostatisticians piloting the plane (Mark van der Laan, Nicolas Jewell, etc.). I avoided a rigorous study of causal inference but eventually came around after studying Bayesian networks (pioneered by Judea Pearl) for decision analysis. Judea Pearl’s Bayesian networks and causal graphs connects the fields of statistics, epidemiology, decision and computer sciences in a profoundly elegant way. His work empowers and expands the potential of”big data.” This is the first book written for the general public on this topic. It will have a huge impact. Causality and causal reasoning is at the core of everything we see, do, and imagine. He provides a graphical tool (causal graphs) for encoding expert knowledge (including community wisdom and experience). Anyone—yes, anyone—can learn the basics. For additional rigor, there are structural causal models (functional equations). I now consider it “data scientific malpractice” to be designing studies, analyzing data, and adjusting for confounders without using causal models. Human brains are wired to resist new paradigms.

    "text": "Most of what we know about our emotions (and how our brains work) is just plain wrong—and sometimes harmful! Myth: our emotions are hard-wired by evolution in our “limbic” (“reptilian”) brain and emotions are “triggered.” Myth: across the globe humans have universal facial expressions for core emotions (e.g., joy causes smiling). Myth: we control our emotions with our “rational” (neocortex) brain. Myth: the amygdala is the “fear center” of the brain. Myth: we can learn to read others’ emotions with reliability. Myth: seeing is believing. Myth: we cannot go wrong trusting our “gut” feeling.\nReading Lisa Feldman Barrett’s How Emotions are Made: The secret life of the brain was transformative. Our emotions, brain, and body do not function as depicted by brain science myths that have been debunked, but persist because scientists, health professionals, and the “emotion,” “emotional-intelligence,” and “brain science” industries are not current with the latest neuroscience. This book will set you on the right course.\nAt birth, the brain is a blank slate awaiting “wiring instructions” from a caregiver. Every second we are alive the brain processes “big data” of sensory input from our body (through interoception) and from the external world (through our senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Through evolution, humans solved a neurobio-engineering problem: how do we efficiently procure and balance energy and accumulate learnings on how to survive and procreate. The brain evolved into a predictive learning machine. The memories we accumulate through experiences become the predictions (“hypotheses” or “priors”) that the brain compares to new sensory input (“evidence”). The gap between prediction and sensory input is prediction error. If the prediction error is small or negligible the brain accepts the prediction, thereby saving cognitive energy expenditure. If the prediction error is large (e.g., cognitive dissonance), the brain must choose either to accept the prediction (cognitively and energy efficient, so our brain strongly prefers this), or to learn (cognitively and energy inefficient, so our brain strongly resists this).\nThe brain must make meaning of this sensory input in order to prepare for what the body needs to do next (based on prior experiences) to survive, etc. The brain prepares the body to respond through our nervous, cardiovascular, immune, endrocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Emotions are the on-the-spot meanings the brain gives to these external and internal sensory input (bodily sensations). “In other words, emotions are your brain’s best guess of how you should feel in the moment. Emotions aren’t wired into your brain like little circuits; they’re made on demand. As a result, you have more control over your emotions than you might think.”1\nAll of this happens automatically at a nonconscious level: that is why it “feels” like our emotions are “triggered.” In fact, our emotions are constructed in the moment based on:\nThe implications of understanding this evolution-designed engineering achievement are huge! How the brain processes the big data of sensory input also provides lessons on how we should process the new big data we are accumulating in the “cloud.” (Hint: read my book review of Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect.)"

    "text": "Designing an emotionally fulfilling life\nEven today, we are taught, incorrectly, that emotions are hardwired by evolution and that we should “control” (i.e., suppress), accept (i.e., embrace), or release emotions. For example, someone or something “triggers” an emotion and a stress response (“fight-flight-freeze”) in us, and we can use mindfulness to notice, acknowledge, and “release” this emotion. Yes, mindfulness works; however, mindfulness is much more powerful when we understand that emotions are acutually constructed rathered than “triggered.”\nWe have the power to design and build an emotionally fulfilling life by the experiences we choose to have and the cognitive and motor memories we encode in our brains. This explains how “doing” rewires the brain! Interestingly, Buddhism3 practices (e.g., mindfulness meditation) align nicely with this modern scientific understanding of brain and emotions. For example, Dr. Barrett studies and describes how Buddhism can strengthen interpersonal relationships and improve your brain and body health.4\nMindfulness promotes stillness, awareness, and being in the moment without judgment or expectation. Then, we can exercise curiosity about what contributed or is contributing to our feelings (affect) and emotions (meaning). This is critical because our brains are quick to draw false conclusions to save cognitive energy rather than to “get it right.” Interestingly, the more vocabulary we have to describe feelings and emotions, the more ability we have to recognize these in ourselves and others. This is called emotional granularity and is the actual basis of emotional intelligence.5\nDr. Barrett’s How Emotions are Made covers many practical applications of this emerging science, including mitigating implicit racial bias."

She shares the results of her exhaustive research—and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.”\n\n\n\n\nSee reading list for above TED talk.\n\n\n3 (TED): Cultivating Wisdom: The Power Of Mood\n“Do you believe that what you see influences how you feel? Actually, the opposite is true: What you feel—your affect—influences what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett shares the groundbreaking discovery that you experience the world through affect-colored glasses. She also reveals how affect can be a source of wisdom that helps you to make better, wiser choices”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLFB’s website (includes numerous academic lectures)\nHere is her website with a wealth of material: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/."

    "title": "Never say never: Why I moved from local to state public health",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), local public health practice provided me with many unique challenges and opportunities. I was also the director of the Population Health Division that provided core public health services. I grew tremendously in my organizational and community leadership roles, and my partnerships with academic institutions such as UCSF and UC Berkeley School of Public Health fulfilled my nerdy inclinations. Over the years I worked with the California Department of Public Health on a variety of problems from communicable disease outbreaks to radiation concerns at the Hunter Points Naval Shipyard. However, I never—and I mean never!—imagined working for the state public health department—I wanted to stay close to the action; that is, local public health.\nBefore my health officer appointment, I had directed national CDC research and training centers on infectious disease emergency preparedness and response at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. I had put that part of my career completely behind me and was more focused on broader public health challenges such as racial health inequities. I also developed a strong interest in leadership development, decision intelligence, and organizational performance improvement. The SFDPH became a laboratory for testing, learning, and teaching. I was professionally and intellectually fulfilled.\nThat all changed with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In December 2019, we started receiving news about an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Because of my training and expertise in communicable diseases, and my experience with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic flu in 2009, I was especially attuned to the evolving events.\nOn January 13, 2020, I med with Dr. Julie Stoltey, our communicable disease controller, and on January 21st we activated our Departmental Operations Center (DOC). We have been working non-stop since with very few days off. The pandemic not only disrupted our society and economy, it revealed and amplified pre-existing racial inequities. It also revealed the longstanding neglect of the public health infrastructure at all levels of government. Finally, people started to understand what is public health.\nMarch 15, 2020, a group of seven Bay Area health officers, led by Dr.Sara Cody, issued the first stay-at-home orders in the United States. We successfully prevented many cases, hospitalization, and deaths. Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of a long haul of fighting this relentless and unforgiving pandemic. Fortunately, the rapid development of effective vaccines meant real hope was around the corner, and that we would be transitioning into a recovery and rebuilding phase. This also means rebuilding the public health infrastructure for the 21st century.\nWhen the job announcement for the CDPH director and state public health officer was posted, I immediately applied. I could not pass up the opportunity to shape the future of public health services for a state of 40 million people, to advocate for the resources to rebuild our public health infrastructure, and to fight for social and racial equity and health on a larger stage. I was humbled and honored to be selected to serve in this position at this critical time in our history.\nI just completed seven weeks! I am exhausted, and at times overwhelmed and over extended! (So, what else is new!) My strongest impression working at CDPH is the enormous level of staff dedication, kindness, ingenuity, and passion for public service and science. I am inspired every single day! The CDPH staff are working 24/7 to protect and promote health and safety for the diverse counties and communities across the state. It’s a huge privilege to work more closely with health officials of the County Health Executives Association of California (CHEAC) and the Health Officers Association of California (HOAC), and with stakeholder and advocacy groups representing the diverse interests of California residents. They too are working just as hard and long to protect all of us.\nRebuilding public health requires everyone. I hope you will reach out to me and provide input and feedback on our and my performance, and how we can “become the best at getting better” in service to you.\nTo learn more about CDPH visit https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/About.aspx."

    "text": "Figure 1: Decision intelligence is using science and technology to support teams and individuals to improve decision making for finding and solving problems, and improving performance in novel, challenging environments, including volatile, uncertain, complex, or ambiguous (VUCA) environments.\nDecision-making is our most important activity. “A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources” [1]. Decisions drive vision, strategy, policy, and transformational change. Every decision has causal assumptions, predictions, trade-offs, and an opportunity cost—the lost benefit of the better option(s) not chosen or not considered.\nMost decisions are quick or automatic and are influenced by intuition. Occasionally, we slow down to deliberate (often in teams) and we are influenced by our intuition, non-conscious cognitive processes, group psychology, power dynamics, and politics.\nIn spite of the importance of decision making, few are trained on how to make better decisions. I am often asked what are my favorite decision books. To promote better decision making I list several here in their primary category.\nPlease send me your favorite decision book recommendations and why you like them."
